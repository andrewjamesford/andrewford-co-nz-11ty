### Then

I'm an <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrewjamesford/">experienced full
stack developer</a> working professionally in the web industry since the
year 2000. Having worked on small sites for local business to large sites for
corporations including Sony, Panasonic, Comvita, Zespri, Trust Power, Farmlands,
Lion Nathan, Destination Great Lake Taupo, Craigs Investment Partners and Fisher
& Paykel Healthcare to name but a few. These sites exposed me to a wide range of
CMS systems from bespoke solutions, to Wordpress, Umbraco and Sitecore.

Over the last 10 years I've progressed to building bespoke web and mobile
applications. Using technologies like AngularJS and ReactJS (including React
Native) for SaaS companies and an ERP system for local government (councils).

Previously I was the Lead Developer of a small team, working on a cloud based

with .Net Core, ReactJS, Docker, Kubernetes and PostgresDB, hosted on AWS.

I've been slowly working my way through some of the videos from Microsofts Build Conference for 2016. There are too many to watch almost, but here are some of my favourites.

<h2>Visual Studio Code - Tips &amp; Tricks</h2>

Admittedly I'm a big fan of Visual Studio Code. It's almost everything I want in an editor. Light weight, easy to use, smart auto completion out of the box with Git integration. This video will take your from novice to pro user of VS Code.

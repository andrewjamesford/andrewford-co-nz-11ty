<a href="http://facebook.github.io/react/">ReactJS</a> is all the rage in the JavaScript community. It allows you to build an apps UI as discrete components that pass the data in a one-way reactive flow. It's a library just for the view of MVC. But it's not a framework.

I've been using ReactJS for a proof of concept at work and using the mobile library <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react-native/">React Native</a> for my local <a href="http://www.meetup.com/TaurangaWeb/">web meetup</a> project <a href="https://github.com/codevelopnz/SmartSolarMobile">Smart Solar</a>.

Things I like about ReactJS:

<ul>
    <li>Making all your components self contained blocks is how I've always tried to build out my UI. React takes this to another level having the JS and HTML embeded together.</li>
    <li>I got up to speed a lot faster with ReactJS then Angular 1. The concepts are a lot more simplistic. ReactJS doesn't have as many concepts to learn like factories, ng syntax and directives with Angular (or let alone when to use the appropriate one).</li>
</ul>

My learning path to get started with ReactJS was the following:

<ul>
    <li>Follow the <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/getting-started.html">getting started</a> guide on Facebooks documentation for ReactJS</li>
    <li>Started building a simple proof of concept application</li>
    <li>Watch and follow along with the <a href="https://egghead.io/series/react-fundamentals">React Fundamentals</a> course on <a href="https://egghead.io">egghead.io</a></li>
    <li>Watch and follow along with the <a href="https://egghead.io/series/build-your-first-react-js-application">Build your first React.js App</a> course on <a href="https://egghead.io">egghead.io</a></li>
    <li>I'd also recommend you get up to speed with EcmaScript 2015 (ES6), the Tree House blog has a good <a href="http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/get-started-ecmascript-6">primer</a></li>
</ul>

I got my replacement "duck heads" from the local Apple reseller today. Seven in total.They are still flying out the door as quick as they come in. Suggest you call first before turning up.

Was surprised to see that they are smaller than the original which will make plugging in to a wall socket easier than the previous round head ones.

It's impressive to see Apple making safety a priority and redesigning a safer plug for its customers way back to 2003.

If you have any of the plug "duck heads" I suggest you call your local [Apple Reseller](http://technologycentre.co.nz) or Apple themselves to get yours replaced.

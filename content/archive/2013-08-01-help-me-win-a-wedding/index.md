Lorena and I are entered in the Mid Air Matrimony contest on More FM and would love to win.

So on THURSDAY the 1st of August I would love it if you could like us on this page here:

<a href="http://bit.ly/lorena4andrew" title="Vote for us on the More FM site">Mid Air Matrimony on More FM</a>

Please tell all your friends and families to vote for us as the most "Likes" wins. All you need is a Facebook account. Click on the "Like" button for Lorena & Andrew on the More FM site (link above).

If we win we will be flying business class to Fiji next week on Fiji Airways and staying at either the Westin Denarau Island Resort and Spa Fiji or the Radisson BLU Resort Fiji Denarau Island. Somewhere between Auckland and Nadi we will tie the knot, what a story for the grandkids. :)

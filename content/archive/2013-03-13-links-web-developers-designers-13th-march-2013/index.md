Some great links for the 13th of March.

<h2><a href="https://github.com/ericam/compass-animate">Compass Animate</a></h2>

Animation for CSS the easy way. Great set of prebuilt animations available from Dan Eden's <a href="http://daneden.me/animate/">Animate.css</a></p>

<h2><a href="http://designmodo.com/flat-free/">Flat UI</a></h2>

A great looking free and so hot right nown UI pack with HTML/JS and PSD available. Grab the source code from <a href="https://github.com/iurevych/Flat-UI">github</a>.

<h2><a href="http://wp-cli.org/">WP-CLI</a></h2>

Control Wordpress from the command line. Update plugins, update core and create backups of the database with a few quick commands.

<h2><a href="http://kristerkari.github.com/adventures-in-webkit-land/blog/2013/03/08/dealing-with-svg-images-in-mobile-browsers/">Dealing with SVG in mobile browsers</a></h2>

Nice write up of techniques when using SVG files in (mobile) browsers. My favourite is the use of SVGO to optimise SVG files in your site. Seen savings in my own projects of over 50% after exporting from Sketch 2.

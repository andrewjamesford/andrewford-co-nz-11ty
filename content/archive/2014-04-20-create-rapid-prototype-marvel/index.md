Wouldn't it be great if you could create prototypes for an iOS app or a website using the design tool(s) your already familiar with (like <a title="Adobe Photoshop" href="http://www.photoshop.com">Photoshop</a> or <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/nz/app/sketch-3/id852320343?mt=12&amp;uo=4&amp;at=10lnRx" target="itunes_store">Sketch</a>)? Well you can with <a title="Marvel App" href="https://marvelapp.com">Marvel</a>.

<a title="Marvel App" href="https://marvelapp.com">Marvel</a> makes it so simple to turn your pixel perfect mockups into elegant prototypes with nice frame sets representing your targeted device with great transitions between each screen.

To scratch my own annoyance with the now long in the tooth iOS mobile app for <a title="2 Degrees Mobile" href="http://2degreesmobile.co.nz">2 Degrees Mobile</a>, I decided to design a iOS 7 worthy upgrade. I was free to use my design tool of choice, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/nz/app/sketch-3/id852320343?mt=12&amp;uo=4&amp;at=10lnRx" target="itunes_store">Sketch</a> but <a title="Adobe Photoshop" href="http://www.photoshop.com">Photoshop</a> or <a title="Adobe Illustrator" href="http://www.adobe.com/nz/products/illustrator.html">Illustrator</a> could have been used. After designing a handful of screens I then simply created a sub folder in my <a title="Dropbox" href="https://db.tt/K9T3k3Q">Dropbox</a> folder that I exported these artboard slices to PNGs.

<a title="Marvel App" href="https://marvelapp.com">Marvel</a> at this stage supports PNG, JPG’s, GIF’s and <a title="Adobe Photoshop" href="http://www.photoshop.com">Photoshop</a> PSD files. I fired up <a title="Apple Safari" href="http://www.apple.com/nz/safari/">safari</a> and created a new project on <a title="Marvel App" href="https://marvelapp.com">Marvelapp.com</a> and pointed the project to the images I created in <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/nz/app/sketch-3/id852320343?mt=12&amp;uo=4&amp;at=10lnRx" target="itunes_store">Sketch</a>. It was insanely simple to add each page, drag a few hotspots on to the image and configure which page they will navigate to and the transition I wanted.

By using <a title="Dropbox" href="https://db.tt/K9T3k3Q">Dropbox</a> a change to the visuals can be easily made, saved and its just a matter of exporting the images. <a title="Dropbox" href="https://db.tt/K9T3k3Q">Dropbox</a> handles the synching. Next time you jump back in to <a title="Marvel App" href="https://marvelapp.com">Marvel</a> the images have updated, while your hotspots have remained the same.

To top off a great experience with the creation of your prototype. <a title="Marvel App" href="https://marvelapp.com">Marvel</a> has two great ways to show it off to potential users/clients. You can simply send a unique URL to the third party (like this <a title="Link to 2 Degrees Mobile prototype" href="http://marvl.in/19c24e">one</a>) via Email, SMS, QR code or if your on the Pro plan you can download it. The short link will open the protoype in their browser. Or you can use the <a title="Marvel - Turn Sketches Into Prototypes" href="https://itunes.apple.com/nz/app/marvel-turn-sketches-into/id765801658?mt=8&amp;uo=4&amp;at=10lnRx">Marvel iPhone app</a> to tryout the prototype on your phone.

<a title="Marvel App" href="https://marvelapp.com">Marvel</a> recently added the ability to embed your prototype in a blog article. Here is the example prototype I created for <a title="2 Degrees Mobile prototype" href="http://marvl.in/19c24e">2 Degrees Mobile</a>.

<div style="text-align: center;"><iframe style="margin: 0 auto; text-align: center;" src="https://marvl.in/19c24e?emb=1" width="384" height="834" frameborder="0" title="2 Degrees Mobile app prototype - interactive demo"></iframe></div>

It's extremely easy to create a prototype in <a title="Marvel App" href="https://marvelapp.com">Marvel</a>, so you can concentrate on making your prototype looks its best. The team at <a title="Marvel App" href="https://marvelapp.com">Marvel</a> have done an amazing job of creating a simple and easy to use product. I needed to spend very little time learning to create hotspots and selecting the pages for my user flow. Simply put I can't recommend this tool enough, and even more so its free to get started. A Pro option is available that allows downloading and password protecting your prototypes at only $5 per month.

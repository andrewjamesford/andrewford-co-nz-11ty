<a href="http://stratechery.com/2013/rebuilding-the-world-technology-destroyed/" title="Ben Thompson - REBUILDING THE WORLD TECHNOLOGY DESTROYED">Ben Thompson</a> reflects on why he got an internship with Apple:

<blockquote>It turned out that a life lived outside of technology was my greatest asset, at least at the company most every founder claims to idolize.</blockquote>

When I reflect on my own insular career path I wish I had a wider point of view of life and humanity. I'm less enthused about technology the older I get and more interested in how technology can help people in their lives. Either by making tasks less tedious, letting them complete tasks more efficiently or even making work fun.

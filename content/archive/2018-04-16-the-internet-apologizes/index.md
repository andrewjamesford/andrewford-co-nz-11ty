Tristan Harris had this to say when interviewed by [New York Magazine](http://nymag.com/selectall/2018/04/an-apology-for-the-internet-from-the-people-who-built-it.html) about what has gone wrong with the Internet.

> I warned about it at Google at the very beginning of 2013. I made that famous slide deck that spread virally throughout the company to 20,000 people. It was called “A Call to Minimize Distraction & Respect Users’ Attention.” It said the tech industry is creating the largest political actor in the world, influencing a billion people’s attention and thoughts every day, and we have a moral responsibility to steer people’s thoughts ethically. It went all the way up to Larry Page, who had three separate meetings that day where people brought it up. And to Google’s credit, I didn’t get fired.

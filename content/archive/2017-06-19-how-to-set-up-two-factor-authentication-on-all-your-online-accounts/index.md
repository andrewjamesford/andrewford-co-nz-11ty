<blockquote>Just about any account you own on the internet is prone to being hacked — and one of the easiest ways to add an extra layer of security is to enable two-factor authentication. Also known as two-step verification or 2FA, the process gives web services a secondary access to the account owner (you!) in order to verify a login attempt. Typically, this involves phone number and / or an email address.</blockquote>
If you haven't already set up 2 factor authentication on all your accounts I recommend you do so immediately.

Dealing with the fallout of a hacked account is too great a risk. Let alone the act of having to update all your accounts passwords especially if for instance your email account is hacked would not be a fun task.

description: "A list of movies I've watched so far in 2016."
---

I liked <a href="http://www.subtraction.com/2016/03/02/movies-watched-so-far-in-2016/">Khoi Vinh's rundown of the movies</a> he's watched. So I thought I'd write-up my own list, and add my 2 cents of what I've watched so far in 2016.

I'm actually stunned at how many movies I've watched to be honest this year. I'm still also watching a couple of TV shows every week.

<h2>January</h2>

<h3><a href="https://geo.itunes.apple.com/nz/movie/mad-max-fury-road/id992278305?at=10lnRx&mt=6" target="_blank">Mad Max Fury Road</a></h3>

Visually amazing movie. Worthy of all the Oscars it garnered.

<h3><a href="https://geo.itunes.apple.com/nz/movie/ant-man/id1012788984?at=10lnRx&mt=6" target="_blank">Ant-Man</a></h3>

A fun watch. Light hearted comic book hero movie. Not too serious.

<h3><a href="https://geo.itunes.apple.com/nz/movie/avengers-age-of-ultron/id983441161?at=10lnRx&mt=6" target="_blank">Avengers Age of Ultron</a></h3>

Better than the first Avengers film. Less confusing too.

<h3><a href="https://geo.itunes.apple.com/nz/movie/home/id967412755?at=10lnRx&mt=6" target="_blank">Home</a></h3>

Very watchable, not what I was expecting. The kids will like it, but there is still something for the adults.

<h3><a href="https://geo.itunes.apple.com/nz/movie/inside-out-2015/id1001746758?at=10lnRx&mt=6" target="_blank">Inside Out</a></h3>

This one will get you in the "feels", not surprisingly for a movie about feelings. Keep some tissues handy.

<h3><a href="https://geo.itunes.apple.com/nz/movie/gravity/id710866868?at=10lnRx&mt=6" target="_blank">Gravity</a></h3>

Space and beating all the odds with just the&nbsp;will to survive.

<h3><a href="https://geo.itunes.apple.com/nz/movie/transformers-dark-of-the-moon/id457992430?at=10lnRx&mt=6" target="_blank">Transformers Dark of the Moon</a></h3>

Just sit back and watch the effects, all eye candy with this one.

<h3><a href="https://geo.itunes.apple.com/nz/movie/the-martian/id1039587313?at=10lnRx&mt=6" target="_blank">The Martian</a></h3>

Another space survival movie. There seems to be a little theme going on in January.

<h3><a href="https://geo.itunes.apple.com/nz/movie/trainwreck/id999061457?at=10lnRx&mt=6" target="_blank">Trainwreck</a></h3>

Amy Schumer is hilarious in this rom-com. LeBron James steals some great scenes, was in fits of laughter.

<h3><a href="https://geo.itunes.apple.com/nz/movie/the-good-dinosaur/id1057860639?at=10lnRx&mt=6" target="_blank">The Good Dinosaur</a></h3>

Another Pixar this month. Still in heavy rotation in the car with the kids. Not Inside Out Good but still enjoyable.

<h2>February</h2>

<h3><a href="https://geo.itunes.apple.com/nz/movie/the-wolf-of-wall-street/id799229628?at=10lnRx&mt=6" target="_blank">Wolf of Wall Street</a></h3>

Greed, greed, greed is what this movie is about.

<h3><a href="https://geo.itunes.apple.com/nz/movie/american-hustle/id799229823?at=10lnRx&mt=6" target="_blank">American Hustle</a>
</h3>

Wasn't what I was expecting. A-list cast keeps it all together.

<h3><a href="https://geo.itunes.apple.com/nz/movie/pitch-perfect-2/id979760248?at=10lnRx&mt=6" target="_blank">Pitch Perfect 2</a></h3>

Just fun, sugar filled entertainment.

<h3><a href="https://geo.itunes.apple.com/us/movie/sisters-unrated/id1062470439?at=10lnRx&mt=6" target="_blank">Sisters</a></h3>

The chemistry of these comedy geniuses makes this movie. Lots of laugh out loud moments.

<h3><a href="https://geo.itunes.apple.com/nz/movie/jobs/id722298716?at=10lnRx&mt=6">Jobs</a></h3>

Ashton Kutcher had a lot of Steve's mannerisms down. Felt like only a brief highlight reel of his career. It finished and I was wanting to know more about Steve.

<h3><a href="https://geo.itunes.apple.com/nz/movie/spectre/id1042425776?at=10lnRx&mt=6">Spectre</a></h3>

Not as good as Skyfall. It was more of the same Bond we love. I liked Skyfall with it exploring his past, with Skyfall it barely again touches on it.

<h3><a href="https://geo.itunes.apple.com/nz/movie/jurassic-world/id972784500?at=10lnRx&mt=6" target="_blank">Jurassic World</a></h3>

As good as the first and it's got dinosaurs. I mean who doesn't love dinosaurs.

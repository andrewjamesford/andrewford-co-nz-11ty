Some great looking tools for rapid prototyping. With these tools you can quickly get your designs on to multiple devices.

## Marvel

Marvel is a great tool that leverages Dropbox for creating web and mobile prototypes. You can use the tools your familiar with like Photoshop or [Sketch by Bohemian Coding](https://itunes.apple.com/nz/app/sketch-3/id852320343). Simply create some screenshots (or just use PSDs) and you can quickly add some hot spots and click through your mockups. They also have an iPhone app that lets you take photos of your rough hand drawn wireframes and build a mockup quickly on your phone.

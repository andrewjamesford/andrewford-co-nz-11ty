The best way I’ve found to learn new programming languages is simply to start using them. So when I had an <a href="https://github.com/andrewjamesford/FlightFareFinder">app idea</a> I wanted to itch I decided to use Swift 2 and jump straight in.

Using the new <a href="https://developer.apple.com/xcode/download/">Xcode 7</a> you don’t even need a developers license to install your own apps on your phone. Which is great for when you want to make a hobby app or are learning as the near $150 NZ fee was an expensive barrier to iOS development previously.

As a primer to get started I quickly skimmed over the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/book/swift-programming-language/id1002622538?mt=11">iBooks swift programming guide</a> and Meng To’s great book <a href="https://designcode.io">Design + Code</a> which has great targeted videos and a guide to complete walkthrough of making an app (in Swift).

While I’ve only been using Swift a very short time I’m already loving these things about Swift:

<ul>
<li>Constants are first class citizens - I’m using “let” all the time rarely using “var”.</li>
<li>The emphasis on immutable data - not changing values can make some great simple code.</li>
<li>Syntax is more like C# and JavaScript - I’m not going to sugar coat it, but Objective C’s syntax is horrible and it never stuck with me. To use a syntax similar to C# and JavaScript  is helping me be more productive with Swift sooner.</li>
<li>Not having to have header files is a great change, compared to Objective C.</li>
</ul>

All in all I’m really enjoying the language and finding it easy enough to get started and already feel proficient enough to build something bigger.

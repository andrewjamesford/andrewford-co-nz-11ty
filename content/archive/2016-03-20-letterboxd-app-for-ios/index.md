If you **love** movies, then do yourself a favour and sign up for [Letterboxd](http://letterboxd.com). They just released their [iOS app](http://itunes.apple.com/app/id1054271011). A great addition to the service.

There are two things that stood out to me in the app as _different_ choices on iOS. Firstly the Letterbox app doesn't have labels on the tab bar at the bottom.

{% figure "./letterboxd-tab-bar.png", "Letterboxd tab bar - sans labels", [1280, 1024, 720, 320], [1280, 1024, 720, 320] %}

Unlike the iTunes app, which clearly shows labels and is translucent.

On some apps I believe this is fine. Say like [Twitterrific](http://twitterrific.com/ios), but only because the icons are recognisable. I don't think that's the case with Letterboxd. There is a small but annoying learning curve just figuring out what each button does. In the case of Letterboxd I think it would have been better to have labels.

Purely by coincidence Letterboxd was released the same week Google updated the "Material Design" guidelines adding a [bottom navigation bar](https://www.google.com/design/spec/components/bottom-navigation.html#bottom-navigation-style) similar to the iOS tab bar in Safari on iOS. On Letterboxd as the content is scrolled the tab bar (and navigation bar) is hidden therefore removing a distraction to reading/viewing.

The wait has been long but has been worthwhile for Letterboxd to provide a great [version 1.0 iOS app](https://letterboxd.com/app/). I look forward to what they add next to the service.

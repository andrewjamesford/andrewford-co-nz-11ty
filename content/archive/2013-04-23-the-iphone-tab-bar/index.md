<a href="http://www.significantpixels.com/2011/04/04/the-iphone-tab-bar/" title="The iPhone tab bar - Lessons From Reality">Petter Silfver gives us 5 rules for using the iPhone tab bar</a>

<blockquote>The tab bar is the one thing that is constantly going to be the face of your application to guide the users as they navigate your application. Donâ€™t underestimate the time you need to put into creating a flawless tab bar experience.</blockquote>

Some great lessons about using the tab bar. A pet peeve of mine is the "more" tab. If you need more than 5 tabs please use a "basement" instead.

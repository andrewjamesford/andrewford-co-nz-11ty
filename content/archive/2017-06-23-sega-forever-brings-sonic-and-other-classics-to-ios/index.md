<blockquote>Today, Sega began releasing classic Sega games under the banner Sega Forever.

The first titles released are Sonic the Hedgehog, which was already available on iOS, Comix Zone, Altered Beast, Kid Chameleon, and Phantasy Star II. The games, which are standalone downloads, are free and include ads that can be removed with a $1.99 In-App Purchase. </blockquote>

I was a Sega kid growing up (Nintendo was expensive in NZ and harder to get). This brings back a lot of gaming nostalgia, I remember playing Altered Beast in the arcade. Pity they aren't all available on the Apple TV.

Following my <a href="http://www.andrewford.co.nz/react-js-conf-2016-highlights-day-1/">first day of highlights</a>, here are my highlights of day 2 of React.js Conf 2016.

<h2><a href="https://exponentjs.com">Exponentjs</a></h2>

<h2>React-Native tools demo</h2>

There was a good demo of the react-native performance tools showing performance monitor from JS Core and Systrace to record interactions to find issues, bottlenecks and where they are occurring.

There was an interesting lightning talk on obfuscating your code using <a href="https://github.com/elierotenberg/react-armor">react-armor</a> to hide the class or component name to stop say ad-blockers ruining your layout.

<h2><a href="https://github.com/airbnb/enzyme">Enzyme testing utilities</a></h2>

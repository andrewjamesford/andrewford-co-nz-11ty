Federico Vitticci (<a href="https://twitter.com/viticci" title="@viticci" target="_blank">@viticci</a>) posted a great [article](http://www.macstories.net/stories/life-after-cancer-how-the-iphone-helped-me-achieve-a-healthier-lifestyle/) on how the iPhone has helped him achieve a healthier lifestyle after cancer treatment. He outlines the apps that he currently uses to <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/nz/app/pedometer++/id712286167?mt=8&uo=4&at=10lnRx" title="Pedometer++" target="_blank">record his steps</a>, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/nz/app/lifesum-lifestyle-tracker/id286906691?mt=8&uo=4&at=10lnRx" title="Lifesum" target="_blank">calories</a>, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/nz/app/pillow-smart-sleep-cycle-alarm/id878691772?mt=8&uo=4&at=10lnRx" title="Pillow" target="_blank">sleep patterns</a> and even his <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/nz/app/up-coffee/id828031130?mt=8&uo=4&at=10lnRx" title="UP Coffee" target="_blank">coffee</a> consumption.

I previously <a href="http://www.andrewford.co.nz/self-quantifying/" title="Self Quantifying">blogged</a> about "self quantifying" before, and listed a few of apps I've used myself. It sure feels like the future when we can measure all these health stats, it will be interesting with the release of the Apple Watch what data we can gather.

I've been using Sketch 3 recently (after a long hiatus) and a great productivity tip for iOS 9 design is to take advantage of a GUI template. A GUI template has all the UI elements painstakingly recreated in Sketch, to help you supplement your own designs.

We have two great choices thanks to [Meng To (of Design + Code)](https://designcode.io) and a large group at [Facebook](http://facebook.com/)</a>. Both provide extensive GUI templates of all the most common UI elements for free.

Meng has create both an [iPhone](https://designcode.io/ios9) and [iPad](https://designcode.io/ios9-ipad) (including iPad Pro) GUI template in @1x resolution.

[Facebook](https://facebook.github.io/design/ios9.html) provide an installer for Sketch (DMG) to install the templates with a few clicks. The template comes in @2x resolution.

If you'd like to add these files or any other to the template option it's as simple as heading to **File > New From Template > Reveal in Finder.**

{% figure "./sketch-templates.png", "Sketch Templates", [1280, 1024, 720, 320], [1280, 1024, 720, 320] %}

This will show you the folder in Finder, simply drag your fresh templates into here. Once added you can quickly create a new Sketch file with all these elements available for you to use in your next iOS design.

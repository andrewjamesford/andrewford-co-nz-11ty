<p><font face="Times"><span style="-webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">Have to agree with <a href="http://brooksreview.net/2013/05/going-native/" title="Going Native">Ben</a>, a decent native app is always 10x easier to use on the desktop and mobile. No logging in, far more responsive, no time waiting to download assets, and consistent behaviour to the platform.</span></font></p>

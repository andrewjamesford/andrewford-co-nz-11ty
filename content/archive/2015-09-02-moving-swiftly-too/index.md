Allen Pike talks about his great and enjoyable transition to [Swift](http://www.allenpike.com/2015/moving-swiftly/) since October last year.

I've recently jumped on to the Swift band wagon with the beta's of <a href="https://developer.apple.com/xcode/" target="_blank">Xcode 7</a> and thoroughly enjoyed it too. Swift in my opinion is a much easier to pick up language compared to Objective C.

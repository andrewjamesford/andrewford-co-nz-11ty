I have a [2010 Mac Book Pro](http://www.everymac.com/systems/apple/macbook_pro/specs/macbook-pro-core-i7-2.66-aluminum-15-mid-2010-unibody-specs.html) (MBP) that I'd upgraded for every new release of OSX. Never had I done a fresh install until late last year. While it did help it's performance it didn't make a huge improvement. The PC was still sluggish.

A little bit of history. After only a short length of ownership I'd previously upgraded the ram to 8GB from 4GB (thanks to [OWC](http://eshop.macsales.com/shop/memory/Apple_MacBook_MacBook_Pro/Upgrade/DDR3)). It had a fast for it's time i7 2.66 GHz processor and a 7200 rpm 500GB hard drive. At the time I bought it, I'd never had a faster PC.

When I started looking at prices for a new Mac Book Pro I couldn't justify spending almost $4000 for less storage then I currently had (256GB). Even more so when the current i7 chips in the MBP's are over 2 years old. We still seem to be hanging out for Skylake i7's.

So I started researching SSD drives and found the [Crucial BX200](http://www.crucial.com/usa/en/storage-ssd-bx200) offered good value and performance from [PBTech](<http://www.pbtech.co.nz/index.php?z=p&p=HDDCRU10480&name=Crucial-BX200-480GB-SATA-2.5-7mm-(with-9.5mm-adapt)>) clocking in at 480GB for NZ$250. SSD storage has never been as cheap at under $2 per GB mark. Importantly the Crucial drive includes a spacer to pad out the drive in the Mac Books body.

I'd previously got a screwdriver to fit the Mac from the OWC ram upgrade a Phillips #00. You will also need a T6 Torx screwdriver also, I got mine from [Bunnings](http://www.bunnings.co.nz/fuller-pro-tamperproof-t-6x100mm-screwdriver_p00193579) for $6. Follow the [guide on the Crucial support site](http://guides.crucial.com/Guide/MacBook-Pro-15-Inch-Unibody-2-53-GHz-Mid-2009-SSD-Installation/359/1) as it walks you through step by step with images. It's a easy install taking less than 30 minutes.

Once installed I suggest you do a clean install of El Capitan. I followed the [Mashable guide](http://mashable.com/2015/10/01/clean-install-os-x-el-capitan/#8NeoXDu_zEqZ) and created a USB installer.

After a month the drive has given my MBP a new lease on life. It's faster than it's ever been, and the battery lasts longer now. Getting another hour, for a total of 5 hours compared to 4 previously.

If you have an old Mac without an SSD I'd recommend you install one, well worth the upgrade price.

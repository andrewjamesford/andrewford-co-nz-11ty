>Without saying the words "Russia," "Hillary Clinton," or "Donald Trump," Facebook acknowledged Thursday for the first time what others have been saying for months.

In a paper released by its security division, the company said "malicious actors" used the platform during the 2016 presidential election as part of a campaign "with the intent of harming the reputation of specific political targets."

If you need another reason to leave Facebook, this is a pretty good one.

If they had done something about it prior to the election maybe the world wouldn't be in the position it is now.

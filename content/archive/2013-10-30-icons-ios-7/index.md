iOS7 has now been out for over a month now. A lot of app developers have now released their new takes on apps for the "new look" of iOS. It seems only now designers have had a chance to catch up and offer great icon sets to compliment Apple's own pencil line thin icons. In making my own apps for iOS I've come across a couple of icon sets that you can use too.

## Ionicons

<b>Free and open source (MIT License)</b><br>These icons are to be used in the upcoming <a title="Iconic Framework" href="http://ionicframework.com" target="_blank">Iconic Framework</a> a 100% free and open source beautiful front-end framework for developing native mobile apps in HTML5. The icons come both as an icon font and a set of SVG images. The Ionic icon font is available in the Cocoa pod <a href="https://github.com/TapTemplate/ionicons-iOS">ionicions-iOS</a>.

## Essence Icon Set

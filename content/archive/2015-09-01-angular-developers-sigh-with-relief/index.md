The AngularJS community have felt a little nervous since the announcement of Angular 2 and the intention for it not to be backwards compatible. But can now breathe easy. A couple of days ago the Angular team posted on their blog the announcement that there will be a path to [incremental upgrades](http://angularjs.blogspot.co.nz/2015/08/angular-1-and-angular-2-coexistence.html) so Angular 1 &amp; 2 can co-exist in the same web app.

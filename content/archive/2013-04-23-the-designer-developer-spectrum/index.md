> Designers and developers—like any other group of people—shouldn’t be pigeonholed into separate roles. Doing so is damaging to individuals, your company, and the entire industry. Quality products and cultures thrive on employing people with a broad set of skills and at least one specialization. Embrace the sliding spectrum of skills.

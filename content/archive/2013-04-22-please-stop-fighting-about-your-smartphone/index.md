<a href="http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/?p=133719">Mat Honan at Wired:</a>

<blockquote>Nobody cares what kind of smartphone you believe in. It’s not a religion. It’s not your local sports team even. Stop being a soldier. You are not a soldier. You are just wrong. Shut up. You there, with the blog, in the comments, in the pages of the newspaper or the magazine or on Twitter or Facebook. Whatever your opinion is, as soon as you employ it in partisan fashion, it’s deeply and profoundly wrong. Just by sharing it, you are wrong. And nobody cares. Except for the people who do. And they are wrong too. Myself included.</blockquote>

Matt points out the obvious irrational behaviour of people in tech. At the end of the day buy/love what's right for you.

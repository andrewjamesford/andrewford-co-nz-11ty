I’ve been working remotely now for over 6 months with <a href="http://www.monitorbm.com" title="Monitor Business Machines">Monitor</a> from home. Its been a tough but overall enjoyable time. Here are some points about my experience and some advice.

<strong>The good parts:</strong>

<ul>
<li>I’ve gone from novice to more than competent with Angular JS with majority of work to date been building an Angular web app that’s responsive.</li>
<li>Worked with iOS and Android, adding features to Monitor’s mobile apps.</li>
<li>Become very competent with building an API in .Net Web API.</li>
<li>I’m spending more time working on my Mac for app development, Windows 8's UI is pretty horrible.</li>
<li>I get to see my wife for lunch when she’s not working. Plus I’m always home for the kids.</li>
<li>My cooking skills have improved as I’m always home first to start cooking dinner.</li>
<li>I’m not wasting up to an hour each day on commuting. Not having to drive for 10 minutes to get to work like I did previously is a big stress reducer.</li>
</ul>

<strong>The hard parts:</strong>

<ul>
<li>Communication is hard when working remotely, even with all the tools available now for it. I find I need to have face to face visits every month and constantly strive to keep my team aware of my progress and issues I come across.</li>
<li>I work a lot more hours working remotely, often I’ll put the kids to bed and whip out to the garage for a couple of hours “just to get some things done” or spend an afternoon on the weekend working. It’s “normal” for me to do 50+ hour weeks simply cause I can.</li>
<li>Working remotely can be lonely. I find I need to do activities to socialise outside of work like <a href="http://www.volleyballbop.co.nz" title="Volleyball BOP">social beach volleyball</a> and <a href="http://www.meetup.com/TaurangaWeb/" title="Tauranga Web Meetup">meetups</a>. Some weeks I never leave the suburb of where I live.</li>
<li>Work and home life separation is difficult, it’s too easy to work in the evenings.</li>
<li>I’m putting on weight very quickly as food is always at hand in the pantry. I may be walking to work, but the distance isn’t very far.</li>
</ul>

<strong>My tips:</strong>

<ul>
<li>Make a space where you can work alone without distractions, I’ve made part of our garage into my office.</li>
<li>Get into a routine, start at the same time everyday just like going to a normal job.</li>
<li>Make sure you get outside the house to do social activities at least once a week.</li>
<li>Fast unlimited internet is a must, I’m eyeing up all the current deals on offer for <a href="http://billbennett.co.nz/2015/02/04/unlimited-fibre-broadband-plans/" title="Unlimited Fibre in New Zealand">fibre</a> they have come down in price the short time I’ve been working from home.</li>
<li>Over communicate is the best policy I'm finding. I'm constantly updating my team members on Skype and email.</li>
<li>Read these two books <a href="http://www.andrewford.co.nz/remote-office-required-best-bits/" title="Remote: Office Not Required">Remote: Office Not Required</a> and <a href="http://www.andrewford.co.nz/the-year-without-pants-wordpress-com-and-the-future-of-work-by-scott-berkun-review/" title="The Year Without Pants: WordPress.com and the Future of Work ">The Year Without Pants: WordPress.com and the Future of Work</a>.</li>
</ul>

Overall the experience has been great. It allows me to do a very challenging job thats rewarding in learning experiences from the comfort of my own home without the stress of a commute to work. On top of that I'm able to maximise my time with my family, which is priceless.

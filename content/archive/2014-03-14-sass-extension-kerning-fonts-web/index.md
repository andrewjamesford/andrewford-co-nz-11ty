Want your web font's to look better? Enable kerning of your web font's thanks to <a href="http://blog.typekit.com/2014/02/05/kerning-on-the-web/" title="Kerning on the web - Typekit Blog" target="_blank">Typekit's recommendations</a>.

<blockquote>Kerning can refer to one of two things: spacing instructions that type designers put into font files to mitigate awkward character combinations, or spacing adjustments that graphic designers make as they typeset text. </blockquote>

Here is the Gist of some SCSS (SASS) to use in your next web project to easily enable kerning.

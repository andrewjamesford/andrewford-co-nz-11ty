I was reading a great blog post on [travel hacking](http://lifehacker.com/5841147/the-ultimate-travel-hacking-guide) from the team at LifeHacker. So I thought I'd give some of my pointers.

From that article I found my favourite new flight comparison tool, [SkyScanner](http://www.skyscanner.co.nz/) and the best part is it's in NZ dollars.

Web Jet have a nice monthly deal finder search tool, choose your destination and it can tell you the best price for the next 6 months. [Web Jet](http://www.webjet.co.nz/)

Here are a few of my own tips for Air New Zealand:

### Tip 1

For Air New Zealand flyers if you've flown in the last 7 days make sure you enter your details on Air Ponts Lucky Seven
**Tip 1:** For Air New Zealand flyers if you've flown in the last 7 days make sure you enter your details on [Air Points Lucky Seven](https://www.airpointsluckyseven.co.nz/) and keep checking back everyday at midday to see if you've won.

### Tip 2

Earn Air New Zealand airpoints the easy way by getting a Go Fly Kiwibank mastercard, spend over 15k on it and you'll also get free Koru lounge passes. [Go Fly credit card](http://www.kiwibank.co.nz/personal-banking/credit-cards/gofly/) There are also other [credit cards](http://www.airnewzealand.co.nz/airpoints-direct-earn-credit-card-comparison-table) that can help you wing your way overseas.

<strong>Tip 3:</strong> With the above credit card every thursday, they have a simple trivia competition for air-points as well as special grab a seat deals for Go Fly Kiwibank customers <a title="Go Fly promo" href="https://www.kiwibank.co.nz/go-fly-promotion/" target="_blank">https://www.kiwibank.co.nz/go-fly-promotion/</a>

<strong>Tip 4:</strong> Combine your Fly Buys to your Air New Zealand air points, be aware that the conversion rate is pretty low though 1 Airpoints Dollar for every 6.25 Fly Buys Points. <a title="Flybuys to Airpoints" href="https://www.flybuys.co.nz/Airpoints/Pages/Default.aspx" target="_blank">https://www.flybuys.co.nz/Airpoints/Pages/Default.aspx</a>

<strong>Tip 5:</strong>  Sign up for Colmar Brunton surveys to get more Fly Buys points <a title="All the details about signing up for surveys" href="http://www.flybuyspromotions.co.nz/July07ColmarBrunton/CB.html" target="_blank">http://www.flybuyspromotions.co.nz/July07ColmarBrunton/CB.html</a>. Every week or so I get emails to complete surveys for Fly Buys points.

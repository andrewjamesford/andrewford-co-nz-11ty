[Eleanor Ainge Roy](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/apr/10/facebook-data-breach-hits-63714-new-zealanders-after-10-people-download-quiz) @ The Guardian:

> “For New Zealand, we estimate a total of 63,724 people may have been impacted – 10 are estimated to have downloaded the quiz app with 63,714 friends possibly impacted,” said Antonia Sanda, head of communications for Facebook in Australia and New Zealand.

All it took was 10 people to sign up for a quiz that allowed their friends & families information to be scraped by Cambridge Analytica. This is only one firm of dozens that targeted users information in this manner, while Facebook failed to protect it's users knowing full well this was happening.

<blockquote>Google has hired veteran chip architect Manu Gulati, who worked at Apple for the past eight years, according to Variety.

Gulati is now a Lead SOC Architect at Google, where he began in May, according to his recently updated LinkedIn profile.

Gulati was "instrumental" to the company's efforts to build custom chips for the iPad, iPhone, and Apple TV, according to the report.</blockquote>
Now this could get interesting. Will Google be a threat to Apple? Or more likely to the Android device makers Samsung, HTC etc.

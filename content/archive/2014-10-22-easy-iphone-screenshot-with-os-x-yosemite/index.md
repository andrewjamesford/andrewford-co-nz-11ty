A great new feature added to QuickTime player with OS X Yosemite is the ability to record your iPhones screen, simply by plugging it into your Mac with a lightning cable and setting the recording source to your phone.

It's very easy once your showing the screen on your desktop to take a screenshot.

- Simply focus the mouse cursor away from the Quicktime window and press Command-Shift-4 (&#8984; +&nbsp;&#8679; +&nbsp;&#9315;).
- Highlight the QuickTime window and press the spacebar. This will change the cursor to a camera.
- Then click the QuickTime window again to save a screenshot to your desktop.

This will save a nice PNG to your desktop with a tidy version of the status bar (time set to 9:41 AM and the carrier removed).

{% figure "./clean-status-bar.png", "A clean status bar with the carrier name removed and the time set to 9:41 am", [1280, 1024, 720, 320], [1280, 1024, 720, 320] %}

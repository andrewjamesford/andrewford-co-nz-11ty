[Bill Bennett](http://billbennett.co.nz/2015/09/04/android-hardware-makers-stare-into-profitless-abyss/) paints a bleak outlook for Android phone manufacturers.

<blockquote>Android phone makers taken as a whole lose money. Even the handful making a profit get paltry returns. Most would be better off if they left their money in the bank.</blockquote>

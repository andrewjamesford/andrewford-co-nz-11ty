While I may not have attended day 1 of <a href="http://conf.reactjs.com">React.js Conf</a> today, I did get to listen to the conference live streamed from San Francisco. Here are my short cherry picked highlights of things that I thought were cool.

<h2><a href="https://facebook.github.io/draft-js/">Draft.js</a></h2>

Draft.js was announced from Facebook. It's a rich text editor framework for React that uses Immutable.js. It's fully customisable and should scale from a simple multiline input to a full text editor.

<h2><a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vsmobile.vscode-react-native">React Native Tools</a> for <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com">VS Code</a></h2>

React Native Tools for my favourite text editor VS Code was announced today. It's available as a <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vsmobile.vscode-react-native">preview</a>. It supports Intellisense for React Native and debugging code.

<h2>Continuous Integration and Code Push for React Native</h2>

Microsoft have added continuous integration for React Native to <a href="https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/products/visual-studio-team-services-vs.aspx">Visual Studio Team Services</a>, combined with <a href="https://microsoft.github.io/code-push/">Code Push</a>. Now just like in web development, updates can simply be pushed live avoiding the app store/play store update process.

<h2>Oy - email template tools for React</h2>

A collection of <a href="https://github.com/revivek/oy">utilities for email templates</a> was demoed.

<h2>Nuclide React Native Tools demoed</h2>

<a href="http://nuclide.io">Nuclide</a> a package for Atom editor was "<a href="https://github.com/zertosh/NuclideReactNativeSampleApp">demoed</a>" showing the packager, debugger and inspector.

<h2><a href="https://realm.io/news/introducing-realm-react-native/">Realm for React-Native</a></h2>

Realm the mobile database is now available for React-Native.

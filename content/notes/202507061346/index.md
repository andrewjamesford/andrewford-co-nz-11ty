I recently bought an iPad not because I wanted to just watch more content or play more games. I wanted to see how far I could push working with AI tools is more of a creative process away from a keyboard. I probably wouldn't have even considered this up till recently until the beta of iPadOS 26 now has proper windowing.

I have been using the iPad for a few weeks now and I have to say that I am impressed with how well it works. The windowing feature is a game changer for me. I can now have multiple apps open at the same time and switch between them easily. This has made it much easier to work on my projects and stay organized.

 So there are a couple of ways I use it, a lot of the time just using Safari opening ChatGPT or Claude or Perplexity and scoping out some sort of proof of concept. It works really well for this, the art effects/canvas work really well and it's amazing how quickly a proof of concept comes together. I find a big benefit of having the iPad and the situation is it stops me from getting distracted from other things and stops my usual wish to start opening the code files and making changes. Instead, I can focus on the creative side of things, brainstorming ideas and exploring different concepts without getting bogged down in the technical details. Don't know that it also means that I can make three different concepts and minutes of each other to get exposed to lots of different ideas.

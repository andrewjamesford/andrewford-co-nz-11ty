Even with a ultra widescreen monitor (21:9) I don't have a huge number of apps that sit in my menu bar. In fact I try to run the bare minimum (no need for [Bartender](https://www.macbartender.com) or [Dozer](https://github.com/Mortennn/Dozer) for me). 

Here are my current apps that take up that space in the right hand corner:

## [Clipy](https://clipy-app.com) - Free

**Clipy** extends your clipboard. When you need to copy and paste multiple items or need to paste that item you copied multiple copy and pastes ago it allows you to go back and paste from your history.

I have it bound to `command + shift + v` and use it constantly. Just be sure to exclude your password manager like LastPass or 1Password from the preferences menu, best not to leave your passwords in your history.

## [Magnet](https://magnet.crowdcafe.com) - Paid MAS

One thing I miss about window management on MacOS compared to Windows is being able to drag windows to either the left or right of the desktop and have them auto size to half the desktop (when not full screen). Magnet let's you do this. You can drag a window to the left or the right of the desktop and it will resize the window to half the desktop. It also has other options to use a 1/4 or 1/3 etc and can be controlled by keyboard shortcuts.

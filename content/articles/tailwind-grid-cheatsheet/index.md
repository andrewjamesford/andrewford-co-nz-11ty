Again [scratching my own itch](https://andrewford.co.nz/articles/tailwind-flexbox-cheatsheet/) I decided to create a cheatsheet for Tailwind's grid system. I've been using Tailwind for a while now and I still find myself looking up the grid classes. I'm a visual learner so I wanted something I could glance at and get the information I needed.

As always open to suggestions [email me](mailto:hireme@andrewford.co.nz).

{% include "promos/tailwindgridcheatsheet.njk" %}

I also have a [Flexbox Cheatsheet](https://andrewford.co.nz/articles/tailwind-flexbox-cheatsheet/) for Tailwind CSS, buy both together and save!

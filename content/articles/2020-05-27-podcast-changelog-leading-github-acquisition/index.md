description: A great podcast episode recommendation with an interview of Jason Warner CTO at GitHub
--- 

I just listened to a great podcast [episode of The Changelog](https://changelog.com/podcast/395) where Jerod & Adam interviewed Jason Warner the CTO at GitHub. They delve into some of the backstory of how Jason helped GitHub to a $7.5 billion acquisition by Microsoft, remote working both pre and during the time of Covid 19 and general advice for developers progression paths. It's well worth your listen.

[Matt Briggs](http://mattbriggs.net/blog/2015/06/01/the-role-of-a-senior-developer/) gives some broad descriptions of the levels of developers.

<blockquote>
A senior developer understands that everything in our field involves tradeoff, and will look for what that is for design patterns, libraries, frameworks, and processes.
</blockquote>

Software development is all about compromises, and prioritising the right ones.

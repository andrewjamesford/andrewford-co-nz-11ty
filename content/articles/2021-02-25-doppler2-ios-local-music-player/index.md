In the age of streaming, especially music why would you want a music player that only plays local music? The simple answer is, even in 2021 we don't have consistent mobile data networks. A recent example of this for me was when running in the [26th Taupo Great Lake Relay](https://eventpromotions.co.nz/taupo-great-lake-relay/), on my leg there was no mobile signal.

description: "Need a second screen when working from home and you have an iPad"

One thing you may be missing when working from home on a laptop is a second screen. If you have an iPad (or Android tablet) floating round home you can use [Duet Display](https://www.duetdisplay.com) to  extend your desktop. It works with both MacOS and Windows 10.

I'm using it with a MacBook Pro and an original iPad mini as a second screen for an [iTerm](https://iterm2.com) terminal while I develop. I'm propping it up with an Ikea tablet stand, plugged in via a USB C to lightning cable. It works great with no lag.

I have to say I don't think I'll ever go back to standard CSS again, even for a static HTML site. The benefits of using LESS are just too great. The LESS CSS site can explain it better than I, check out the [examples and explanations](http://lesscss.org/) for a great intro.\n\nThe benefits of being able to quickly change the colour scheme by replacing a few variables, add cross browser vendor prefixed CSS in one line and to quickly create grids tailored to your project far out weigh the portability of standard CSS.",

It can reference external CDN files e.g. for jQuery etc and local files in the same call, using the local file for development and the external file when going live. It will compile you LESS files on save so all that is needed to see your changes in the browser when developing locally is a refresh.\n\n## Using the plugin in Visual Studio 2010 Mindscape Web Workbench",

On a Mac there are a multitude of options but by far my favourite is the application CodeKit. It allows importing from other folders, processing of many other CSS dynamic languages and the minification and combining of files. Other applications of note are SimpLESS which is multi-platform, and LESS app for Mac by the same developer as CodeKit. If you are just starting out I'd recommend CodeKit to start with, it's easier to setup and independent of the language your developing on also it will notify you of errors when compiling the LESS to CSS. CodeKit isn't free but in my opinion is worth every cent.\n\n## Getting Started quickly with LESS",

I also find I listen to most podcasts at 1.5x must be because us Kiwis talk a lot faster.\n- [Fantastical](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/fantastical/id575647534?mt=8) - great replacement for the calendar on the iPhone. Quickly see in advance what is coming up in advance with its nice views, gestures and search. Best feature is being able to add events with normal English to clicking, just type away and it will work out what your trying to say in real time.\n- [Timer (by app cubby)](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/timer/id507518845?mt=8) - I use this app pretty much daily especially when cooking. Being able to have a huge range of timers setup ready to go especially on the iPhone 5 longer screen is awesome. I never let anything burn now and I can see multiple countdowns at a glance.\n- [Google Maps](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/google-maps/id585027354?mt=8) - The media made a big deal about the standard maps app for iOS 6 being a disaster. In my own experience I didn't find too many issues with it. But I found the smart design of the Google Maps app to be better. Being able to easily. Do fuzzy searches for directions and get quick estimates of drive times made me switch not long after launch.\n- [Launch Center Pro](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/launch-center-pro/id532016360?mt=8) - quick access to actions is the aim of this app, another from app cubby on my list. Being able to quickly toggle the brightness, open apps to certain actions like open the camera on Camera +, or making a hot dial to your partner.\n- [Checkmark](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/checkmark/id524873453?mt=8) - this is how the Reminders app for iOS should be. Having context of location is the best. I can setup reminders so next time I'm at the hardware store it will remind me to pick up the outdoor cleaner.\n- [Letterpress](https://itunes.apple.com/nz/app/letterpress-word-game/id526619424?mt=8) - this is the word game you want to play on iOS. My partner and I continually have a game in session. We're still not bored weeks after we first started playing.",

Chronicle lets you set up bills to pay, the amount and if they recur and sends notifications when they are due. My wife and I share the Dropbox syncing so we can both see what's outstanding and mark them off when paid. It just makes one of those annoyances of life (bills) easier to deal with and that's what technology is for.",

Just like web design trending in a more flat aesthetic to make responsive web design easier on multiple resolutions so to will having flat, texture less apps. It's even reflected in Apples new website, now that it's finally responsive. ((<a href=\"https://www.apple.com\">Apples new responsive website</a>))",

Having narrow sides I think will help you hold the phone with the longer length. I always liked the feel of my 3GS with its curved edges, much nicer to hold then the iPhone 4 and 5.\n\nThere aren’t any ground breaking changes (well maybe NFC) to the new iPhones, just good incremental changes as a whole. I think we’ve seen the last of new big hardware features. From now on the biggest improvements will be on software I believe. iOS 8 is actually what I’m more excited about, with its polished interface improvements and the inter app extensions.\n\n{% figure \"./iphone6-6plus-homescreens.jpg\", \"iPhone 6 & iPhone 6 Plus\" %}",

If battery life is your prime concern, the iPhone 6 Plus may very much be worth it with double the battery life for talk time of the 5S/5C. (([Apple iPhone comparison table](http://www.apple.com/nz/iphone/compare/)))\n\nAn interesting change to the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus is the exclusion of a 32GB model. Only 16, 64 and 128 phones are available, actually making the price points of the latter two quite attractive. Both iPhones are available to order on the 26th of September starting at NZD $999 for the iPhone 6 and $1149 for the iPhone 6 Plus.

It’s not unlike Apple to cannibalise their existing product markets, they have done it before with the iPod and iPod Nano. It will be interesting to see what improvements and features are added to the iPad later this year to justify its purchase.\n\n## Apple Watch\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"//www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ktujsc4ZUTo\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\nThe Apple Watch looks great!

Price may be a barrier for adoption with a RRP of USD $349 and more likely NZD $400+ which is pretty steep when compared with other smart watches already on sale.\n\nThe most important question is the battery life of the Apple Watch, even with the nice “magsafe” charger having a watch you have to remember to charge every night is a deal breaker for me and I’m sure a lot of others.\n\nIt will be interesting to see what more details are dropped before release, and what the final features will be.

This will bring up the recent images and gives you access to iCloud Drive, Photo Library and some other options.

A GUI template has all the UI elements painstakingly recreated in Sketch, to help you supplement your own designs.\n\nWe have two great choices thanks to [Meng To (of Design + Code)](https://designcode.io) and a large group at [Facebook](http://facebook.com/)</a>. Both provide extensive GUI templates of all the most common UI elements for free.\n\nMeng has create both an [iPhone](https://designcode.io/ios9) and [iPad](https://designcode.io/ios9-ipad) (including iPad Pro) GUI template in @1x resolution.",

But there is one downside on the free tier, your photos are compressed (not that you can tell) but none the less you can't download the proper originals.\n\nSo they say you should always have at least two backups, but how without having to sync your phone? Simple use CameraSync on iOS. It doesn't support SMB shares but it does support FTP which is pretty easy to setup.

Typically, this involves phone number and / or an email address.</blockquote>\nIf you haven't already set up 2 factor authentication on all your accounts I recommend you do so immediately.\n\nDealing with the fallout of a hacked account is too great a risk.

In this post I’ll highlight tools and techniques for making React apps fast. Each section also has an interactive, and (hopefully) fun demo!",

The Lifx range support all the 3 of the most popular control systems, Apple Home kit, Goole Home and Amazon Alexa. While it had crossed my mind to use a Raspberry Pi to control home automation, I didn't want the hassle of setup.\n\n{% figure \"./lifx2-small.png\", \"Setup LIFX bulb\" %}\n\nThe process for setup was very easy, first set the bulb up by plugging it in to it's socket and switching the power on. Install the Lifx app on your phone and run through the set up wizard. Once that's done, you can update firmware and optionally set up like in my case for it to work with Homekit, by scanning the code that came with the device.\n\n{% figure \"./lifx1-small.png\", \"Apple Home\" %}",

You have to leave the light switch on for them to work and there is no easy way to turn the light on if you don't have a smart speaker in the room or you iPhone/mac/iPad handy. Ideally there needs to be a cheap, preferably hub-less, Homekit supporting switch, preferably that can hide the existing switch. I may have to investigate [this option](https://www.aqara.com/en/smart_hub-product.html) more.\n\nAs a side note I had originally ordered a [Kogeek Wifi enabled smart switch](https://www.koogeek.com/p-kh02.html) but unfortunately it was incompatible with my light wiring. I still think while having the need for an electrician to install, a smart light switch is a far better alternative than a smart bulb.",

The biggest difference when using on mobile are the connections are initiated much faster in my own experience. WireGuard also offer a modern iOS app that offers easy On Demand activation with exceptions via [SSID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wi-Fi) when on WiFi. This is great to have the VPN only activate automatically on WiFi that is not your home setup.\n\nThe process for setup is documented on the [PiVPN](https://www.pivpn.io/#install) site and the interactive install makes the setup relatively easy. The only difficultly I found was trying to open the port on my router to the Pi on my local network. Entire setup for myself, including on devices was less than 30 mins. Applications are available for almost all platforms to install on your devices (phones, tablets & PCs) on the [WireGuard install page](https://www.wireguard.com/install/).",

We then use the `Math.max()` function to find the largest number in the array, which is 87. Similarly, we use the `Math.min()` function to find the smallest number in the array, which is 1. Note that the `Math.max()` and `Math.min()` functions take a variable number of arguments, so we can pass an array as an argument and it will still work correctly.\n\n## Comparison 3 - Write Tests for Fizz Buzz\n\nLet's get the code assistants to do something very practical.

The result from CL was pretty poor in terms of being able to use right away. As a teaching tool it was helpful in explaining how you could test a JavaScript function detailing the install steps required to set up testing. But it embedded HTML encoded characters, meaning it could not be used right away. GC on the other hand returned some tests that could be used immediately, but the tests it did return were wrong for the context of the function. Three tests only worked if you had supplied a number to the function to test the results, it hadn't taken the context of the function we provided in to consideration (even though GC is supposed to be able to read the open files in VS Code).

Each test uses the `expect` function to make assertions about the output of the `getFizzBuzz` function.\n\n#### CodeLlama getFizzBuzz Tests Answer\n\n> To write tests for the `getFizzBuzz` function, we can use a testing framework such as Jest or Mocha. Here is an example of how to write tests using Jest:\n\n> 1. First, install Jest by running the following command in your terminal:\n\n```bash\nnpm install --save-dev jest\n```\n\n> 1. Next, create a new test file called `getFizzBuzz.test.js` in the same directory as your `getFizzBuzz` function.\n> 2. In this file, import Jest and the `getFizzBuzz` function:",

It converts in my case Markdown files into a fast, easy to maintain blog that I've used since Jan 2021. As per usual upgrading to it was easy. So what's new?\n\n- ESM (ECMAScript Modules) support - so now you can use `import` and `export` in your templates!\n- It's smaller, has fewer dependencies, and is faster to install.\n- Plus a whole lot of other [goodies](https://github.com/11ty/eleventy/releases/tag/v3.0.0)",

After running my security automation workflow, Comet prompted me to save it as a reusable shortcut called \"GitHub List of Security Projects.\"\n\nNow, whenever I need to process a batch of security notifications, I can simply:\n\n1. Navigate to my GitHub security notifications\n2. Trigger the saved shortcut\n3. Let the automation run while I work on other tasks\n\nThis creates a sustainable, repeatable process that scales across any number of repositories.\n\n## Why This Approach Works",

Wireframes were then created in Excalidraw to visualize pages like home, sign up, course listings, and course details. Key requirements around authentication, data storage, roles and permissions were mapped out. Superbase was selected to provide authentication via LinkedIn/Google login as well as for it being a Postgres database. Next.js was chosen for its React framework and Radix UI was selected for accessible, customizable UI components to speed up development.\nogimage: \"build-a-full-stack-next-js-planning.jpg\"\n---",

This transcript has been lightly edited for length and clarity. In this stream I went over the planning stages of a project. First on a virtual whiteboard. I started with a brainstorm of ideas, then moved onto wireframes. Then circled back to start thinking about what features and functionality I would need to build the app. I also talked about the pros and cons of building a UI library from scratch or using something that is already pre-tested and available. Finally I went over the data structure and how I would store the data.\n\nTo view the Wireframes I created in the stream, please see the following link:\n[Wireframes on Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/#json=almP8vw8UnTN7cR6Zk6Xf,aIx7EgfHxXwpKKnv6k3IbQ)\n\n<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xhebsXoSn4>",

This is part 7 of the series. I am continuing a project with an LMS (Learning Management System) using the Storybook.js, Superbase, and Radix UI. So far, I have set up a header component and am working on building other components in isolation using the storybook. The LMS project is in its early stages with a homepage set up and another page for listing data. The Superbase database is connected, with a few tables for courses and students. The next step is to work with Radix components.\n\nThe project is available on [GitHub as LMS NextJS](https://github.com/andrewjamesford/lms-nextjs).\n\nCheck out the [documentation on Radix UI](https://www.Radix-ui.com) components for more information.\n\n<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXvU7F1D59o>\n\n---\n\nAll right, hi there.\n\nI'm back.",

This is part 6 of the series. In this installment we create a Storybook for our project and start building out our Header component. I walk through some of the features of Storybook and how it can help you build your React components in isolation.\n\nThe project is available on [GitHub as LMS NextJS](https://github.com/andrewjamesford/lms-nextjs).\n\nCheck out [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) for more information.\n\n<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGn-MsRIs4U>\n\n---\n\nCan you hear me alright?\n\nJust double checking the stream, always pays to.\n\nCool so we're good, we're good to go.\n\nSound is working.\n\nGetting a little bit of feedback here on my headset but that's OK, I can put up with that.\n\nOK so we've got this header here.\n\nWe built it last time, it's not much to it.",

In the tech community, there is a lot of excitement for where Machine Learning tools like it can be used next.\n\n## What could I use ChatGPT for?\n\n[ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/chat) can be used for a variety of purposes, including creating conversational chatbots and virtual assistants, automated customer service bots, natural language processing tasks such as sentiment analysis or text summarization, and more.",

I wanted to be able to use it from any application on both macOS or iOS, so I put together a way to use the ChatGPT API via an [Apple Shortcut](https://support.apple.com/en-nz/guide/shortcuts/welcome/ios).\n\n## What are Apple Shortcuts?",

I've barely run up any credit so far. Under $0.10, in fact it's very cheap.\n\n## How to use it?\n\nThis shortcut is flexible in that it can be used in multiple ways.

Install my [ChatGPT shortcut from here](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/34ad5973ed41401bab872a407e324da1) and click the \"Get Shortcut\" button\n3. Make sure you have signed in to the ChatGPT app (if not open it now and login)\n4. From the share sheet on an article on Safari scroll the page down to you come across the share action \"ChatGPT\" and tap it\n5. The shortcut will open a prompt asking \"What would you like ChatGPT to do?\"\n6. Enter a prompt of your own choosing, I like to use \"Summarize this article\" or \"Summarize this page\"\n7. The shortcut will show a loading icon and then display your answer in an alert box with a \"Done\" button\n8. The shortcut automatically copies the answer to your clipboard so you can paste it into another app",

It then gets your prompt from the input box that pops up. It then appends say the URL of a website to your prompt. For example I was on an article on [Stuff](https://i.stuff.co.nz/national/education/300847887/chatgpt-how-teachers-are-bringing-ai-tech-into-the-classroom) and this is what is passed to ChatGPT:\n\n```text\n\"Summarise this article\" +\nhttps://i.stuff.co.nz/...\n```\n\nThe shortcut then passes that to the action provided by the ChatGPT iOS app which returns the answer.

Say you have seen an article and you would like to summarise it.\n\nInstead of having to select and copy text to your clipboard which can be hard to do on a iPhone or iPad you can just tap the share sheet and select the ChatGPT shortcut. The shortcut will then perform what you prompt it to do.\n\nThe best part about this as this is you are using your logged in account in the ChatGPT app and can open the app and see the history of all the prompts you have made.

That has changed a lot in the last couple of years with some great new tools that allow much easier collaboration working on the same code base.\n\n## Live Share for Visual Studio Code\n\nA perfect choice for those that already use the extremely popular [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) from Microsoft is the [Live Share](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MS-vsliveshare.vsliveshare) extension. It allows you to share the code on your local PC with a link it copies to your clipboard. Simply send that link to the learners in a [Zoom](https://zoom.us) or [Google Meet](https://meet.google.com) call. Then the entire class will be able to connect to the same session.",

It even shows the cursor position with a little pop up of the person that moved it. It's even possible to share your terminal.\n\nWhile it may get the code sharing running up quickly it's only downside is to run the code locally you would have to setup the environment (installing Node or Python etc which may or may not be an issue).\n\n## Replit\n\nAnother option that allows screen sharing with nothing but a link and a browser is [Replit](https://replit.com/).

It's great for getting started quickly as it has a whole suite of templates for all sorts of projects including NodeJS, Python, Java, Ruby, Go, C#, ReactJS, Vue, and HTML/CSS. No stress about setting up the development environment, just select the appropriate template, run and share the link with your class.\n\nThe other benefit is the code can be forked easily. In the past I've used it for demos while teaching. Learners can take what you started with, fork (make another copy) and make changes to further their own learning in their own time. Of course they can share any changes after.",

The files are static and can't dynamically change like a Node.js or Wordpress website. So I needed a way to get the data from LastFM and display it on my site.

Serverless functions, also known as Functions As A Service, are a way of building and running computer programs without needing to worry about the underlying servers or infrastructure. Instead, a cloud provider takes care of managing the servers and resources, and developers can just write and deploy their code. Serverless functions are triggered by specific events or requests and can quickly execute and shut down when they're finished. This makes them efficient, cost-effective and flexible, and they're often used for tasks that don't require continuous running or need to handle a lot of traffic.\n\nTo be able to make a fetch request, I'm going to add the [Node fetch package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-fetch) to my project, so we can make a get request from the Last FM API to get the last played track for my account.",

In the age of TikTok, ChatGPT, and “TL;DR,” people want instant, relevant answers without wading through walls of text or scrubbing through 30-minute videos (which they’ll probably watch at 2x speed anyway).\n\nWhether reading a blog, seeking support, or navigating a product, attention is the new currency. But myself and most users are bankrupt. So I wanted to build something that respected people’s time: something that gets straight to the point and delivers value fast, with no fluff.\n\n## What Is RAG?\n\n**Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** is an AI pattern that combines two powerful components: a language model (like OpenAI's GPT-4o-mini) and a retrieval system. Instead of relying solely on the model’s training data, RAG actively fetches relevant documents from an external source like a blog, knowledge base, or docset and uses them to generate grounded responses.",

In RAG systems, FAISS is the retrieval engine it searches through vectorised documents to find the ones most relevant to a user’s query.\n\nHere’s how it works in my setup:",

These are manually generated via a function in `generateVectorStore.mjs` and committed to the git repo.\n\nWhen someone asks a question, the system turns that query into a vector and compares it against the stored vectors to find the top matches. These are passed into the language model via LangChain to generate a tailored response.\n\n## Building the Chatbot UI\n\n{% figure \"./rag-chatbot-open.png\", \"The Chatbot UI\" %}\n\nTo keep things lightweight, I built the chatbot in plain **vanilla JavaScript and CSS**—no frameworks, no heavy dependencies.",

View the progress of their exercise via GitHub Classroom, and offer relevant feedback specific to the context of their work. Keep in contact regularly via Slack and Google Meet.

Using them too early in the course would require too much core knowledge and would be totally reliant on the engineer (knowledgeable other) to help build the project. At the end of the course, they have covered all the core knowledge over previous terms and can quite easily make a small web app with authorisation and implement an API with database write and read functionality.

You may have built a website before using the likes of [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev) which will get you the bare bones together to start building. But it doesn't get you that far before you have a huge amount of decisions to make. What routing should I use for my pages? What CSS in JS library? Should I use Tailwind? Will my website have good [SEO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine_optimization)? Very quickly you can be overloaded with decisions.

I teach all these subjects at [Developers Institute](https://www.developers.ac.nz) where I'm a Tech Lead 😉\n\nTo get started building a Next.js application, hopefully you have Node installed ( if not [download here](https://nodejs.org/en/) ) and open up your terminal.\n\n```shell\nnpx create-next-app@latest\n```\n\nFollow the prompts and give it a name \"shop-nextjs-stripe\"\n\nHead into the directory with your new project and start the local development.\n\n```shell\ncd shop-nextjs-stripe\nnpm run dev\n```",

You will see 3 folders. The \"pages\" folder is where the routing happens. That will direct the url page in your app. For example if you had a file called `contact-us.js` to be routed to it you would have the following url your browser `http://localhost:3000/contact-us`. This will show the content from that component.\n\nYour **pages** folder will have a **api** folder and two files `_app.js` and `index.js`.\n\nOpen the project in a [browser](http://localhost:3000) and you should see something like this\n\n{% image \"./nextjs-start.png\", \"Next.JS Starter\" %}\n\nGreat the project is up and running in development mode 🙌",

Time to make our first component. Let's make a new folder called `components` and add a file `layout.js` in that directory. Add the following:\n\n```jsx\nimport React from \"react\";\nimport Head from \"next/head\";\n\nimport styles from \"../styles/layout.module.css\";",

To add to that we will add a Header and a Footer component.\n\nAgain in the `components` folder create a `header.js` and a `footer.js` file.\n\nIn the header file add the following:\n\n```jsx\nimport React from \"react\";\n\nexport const Header = () => {\n  return <header></header>;\n};\n```\n\nIn the footer file add the following:\n\n```jsx\nimport React from \"react\";\n\nexport const Footer = () => {\n  return <footer></footer>;\n};\n```\n\nWe need to update the layout component like so (see the comments in the code):",

By default Next.js supports CSS modules, the major benefit with CSS modules is we can avoid CSS name collisions (it makes unique CSS class names) and feel comfortable to delete an unused CSS file as we know it's only relevant to one component. [CSS Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/css-modules-part-1-need/) has a series on CSS Modules worth reading to get a better understanding.\n\nNotice that the corresponding CSS classes above are referenced as a JavaScript object e.g.\n\n```jsx\n<div className={styles.container}>\n```\n\nLet's add the CSS and it's file.

I also wanted to have an easy way to switch which theme/brand the app was using across the board at the deployment level. So same GIT repository, 3 different deployments (domains), all hosted on Azure.\n\nAt work we use [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) which is a utility first CSS framework. Rather than making custom CSS classes for each part of a component you are working on, you add multiple utility classes to each element and never run the issue of another developer (or your self in the future) breaking your design. CSS classes stay consistent and in practise I've found you only need to add on the off occasion a custom CSS class.",

What’s even more exciting is the adoption of the technology companies adding these capabilities to products we already use and love. AI answers have now been incorporated into searches on [Bing](https://www.bing.com/new) and [Google](https://www.google.co.nz), so your answers are provided directly in the search engine itself.

Stopping a developer from needing to switch contexts and having to look up documentation (Peng et al., 2023)[^3].\n- Generating tests: When writing code for software development, it is best practice to write tests to ensure your code is working correctly. Often this can be a mind-numbing task doing simple checks to ensure that when two known values are passed to a function, the expected results are always the same every time the function is run. You can ensure this is the case by writing tests (small pieces of code to check) that test the boundaries of happy and negative paths. Copilot is integrated into your IDE, so it is aware of your code's functions. It knows the expected parameters and can generate these small tests, saving lots of time on repetitive coding (Wermelinger, 2023)[^4].",

Thus reducing the energy consumption of servers (Abhishek et al., 2021)[^7].\n- Promote reduced cost: By optimising efficiency, the software can require smaller servers to reduce the cost of hosting. The reduced cost benefit is an easy sell to employers.\n\nIf each graduate can help make environmentally sustainable efforts for software development in Aotearoa more common, we can get a little closer to our reduction of greenhouse gas emissions goals of 2030, and reduce the impact of climate change.",

But unlike iOS, Popclip is totally extensible.

It’s tailored for ChatGPT and Codex CLI for now, but other tools are adopting similar formats. For GitHub Copilot, I use a workaround—creating an instructions.md file that points to AGENTS.md.\n\nOnce that’s in place, I start expanding on the task in detail. Examples help massively. Through iterative conversations with the agent, I get most of the way there without having to read the code line by line. It’s the kind of work I can do while watching YouTube or multitasking. I just check in, review the results, and guide the next step.",

It lets you style your HTML content by appending a multitude of predefined utility CSS classes to your HTML elements. For example say you were creating a Card component with a heading, description and image using ReactJS.\n\n```jsx\nconst Card = ({ heading, description, image }) => {\n  return (\n    <div className=\"cardContainer\">\n      <img src={image} className=\"cardImage\" alt=\"\" />\n      <div>\n        <h3 className=\"cardHeading\">{heading}</h3>\n        <div className=\"cardDescription\">{description}</div>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  );\n};\n```",

This would require us to create these individual classes in a CSS file. In this scenario there are two things that need to be done:\n\n1. Name our CSS class names: Naming can be difficult, especially when multiple team members are involved. It can lead to confusion, for example, if one person refers to a component as a \"tile\" and another calls it a \"card.\"\n2. Duplication: Repeating the same CSS properties multiple times throughout the CSS file(s) e.g. `margin: 0` and `padding: 1rem` we can end up with a mess that most developers on your team would be afraid to change for fear of regression issues.",

Initially it's a shock to see such a mess of CSS classes for each HTML element. But each class is easy to remember as they map to existing CSS properties, and will not be repeated in the CSS file.\n\n```jsx\nconst Card = ({ heading, description, image }) => {\n  return (\n    <div className=\"rounded-xl shadow-lg bg-white p-4 mb-4 flex gap-2\">\n      <img src={image} className=\"rounded-lg\" alt=\"\" />\n      <div>\n        <h3 className=\"font-bold\">{heading}</h3>\n        <div className=\"font-serif\">{description}</div>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  );\n};\n```\n\n## Why should I use Tailwind CSS?",

If you already know the name of CSS properties and have used the likes of [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2/utilities/spacing/#margin-and-padding) for padding and margin you will quickly feel familiar with Tailwind.\n- Another benefit is that you aren't changing the CSS, instead you are working on the HTML so there is little chance of breaking styling for other parts of your website.\n- You will only have to do a minimal amount of CSS work for the likes of theming or specific custom styles which means your CSS won't grow in size much at all. In fact with the build process your HTML can be scanned to look for the CSS classes and determine if they are not used and can be removed from the CSS file of the website. Therefore only creating a CSS file with the CSS classes used.\n- As the padding and margin values are predefined you won't get the same padding value declared multiple times scattered through your CSS file. You can also check at a glance are elements sharing the same padding or margin by the CSS classes applied without having to use the browser dev tools or find the class in the CSS.\n- No need to write media queries as instead you can use the [utility classes outlined here](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/responsive-design) in the vein of `md:w-32` to only apply the CSS class on the page being **medium** sized.",

        "pageContent": "- File size: Tailwind requires a large number of CSS classes to be added to your HTML, which can lead to longer page load times and larger file sizes if not optimized properly.\n- Learning curve: Tailwind CSS requires a different approach to writing CSS, which can take some time to learn and adjust to.\n- Opinionated design: Tailwind CSS provides pre-defined classes that can be used to quickly style elements, but it also imposes a specific design aesthetic that may not align with the desired look and feel of the website or application.\n- Overuse of classes: Using too many classes on a single element can make the HTML difficult to read and understand, leading to a more complex and harder to maintain codebase.\n- Customization: Tailwind CSS is highly customizable, but this can also lead to increased complexity in terms of configuration, and can make it harder to maintain the design consistency across the project.\n- Hard to remove: It can be challenging to remove Tailwind CSS once it has been implemented. This is because the embedded Tailwind classes are present throughout your HTML, component, or template files, and removing them incrementally can create conflicts with the Tailwind build system. Additionally, it may further complicate the project by requiring an additional build process for the new setup to incrementally replace styling.\n- Waiting on bleeding edge CSS features: Recent years have seen significant advancements in browser CSS capabilities, such as [Container Queries](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Container_Queries), `:has()`, and [Subgrid](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout/Subgrid). While these features can enhance the design and functionality of a website, they can be difficult to implement using Tailwind. In some cases, it may be necessary to wait for them to become available in Tailwind or make changes to the implementation once they are supported.\n- Native is forever: When incorporating a new framework like Tailwind into a project, it will require a learning phase. However, it's important to note that the knowledge acquired is specific to the Tailwind framework, including its class names and naming conventions, which may not be transferable to other frameworks. On the other hand, using CSS in its native form and understanding its intended use will result in a knowledge that will remain useful for a long time.\n- Bare-bones by default: What makes Tailwind different to other frameworks like Bootstrap etc is that you will need to create basic components like footers and headers from scratch, unless you pay for [TailwindUI](https://tailwindui.com). These prebuilt components are not freely available as open source. Instead most build there own components from scratch using the Tailwind CSS classes.",

Although it has some drawbacks, it sits between Bootstrap and native CSS in terms of flexibility and appearance. It avoids the common \"look and feel\" of websites built with Bootstrap, while providing some rails to prevent a large messy CSS file. To get the most out of Tailwind, it is important to adhere to its recommended practices and adjust your process to it's way.\n\nIf this hasn't put you off using Tailwind CSS in your next project I recommend you checking out the [Freecodecamp Learn Tailwind CSS - Course for Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ft30zcMlFao) and my cheat-sheet below.\n\n{% include \"promos/tailwindcheatsheet.njk\" %}",

I probably wouldn’t have even considered this until recently, when the beta of iPadOS 26 introduced proper windowing.\n\nAfter using the iPad for a few weeks, I have to say I’m impressed with how well it works. The windowing feature is a game changer for me. I can now have multiple apps open at the same time and switch between them easily. This has made it much easier to work on the task at hand and stay focused.",

One big benefit of using the iPad is that it helps me avoid distractions and curbs my usual urge to start diving into code and making changes. Instead, I can focus on the creative side, brainstorming ideas and exploring different concepts without getting bogged down in technical details. It also means I can generate three different concepts within minutes (often with the same prompt), giving me exposure to a wide range of ideas.",

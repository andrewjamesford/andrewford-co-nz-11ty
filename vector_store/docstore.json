I have to say I don't think I'll ever go back to standard CSS again, even for a static HTML site. The benefits of using LESS are just too great. The LESS CSS site can explain it better than I, check out the [examples and explanations](http://lesscss.org/) for a great intro.\n\nThe benefits of being able to quickly change the colour scheme by replacing a few variables, add cross browser vendor prefixed CSS in one line and to quickly create grids tailored to your project far out weigh the portability of standard CSS.",

It can reference external CDN files e.g. for jQuery etc and local files in the same call, using the local file for development and the external file when going live. It will compile you LESS files on save so all that is needed to see your changes in the browser when developing locally is a refresh.\n\n## Using the plugin in Visual Studio 2010 Mindscape Web Workbench",

On a Mac there are a multitude of options but by far my favourite is the application CodeKit. It allows importing from other folders, processing of many other CSS dynamic languages and the minification and combining of files. Other applications of note are SimpLESS which is multi-platform, and LESS app for Mac by the same developer as CodeKit. If you are just starting out I'd recommend CodeKit to start with, it's easier to setup and independent of the language your developing on also it will notify you of errors when compiling the LESS to CSS. CodeKit isn't free but in my opinion is worth every cent.\n\n## Getting Started quickly with LESS",

I also find I listen to most podcasts at 1.5x must be because us Kiwis talk a lot faster.\n- [Fantastical](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/fantastical/id575647534?mt=8) - great replacement for the calendar on the iPhone. Quickly see in advance what is coming up in advance with its nice views, gestures and search. Best feature is being able to add events with normal English to clicking, just type away and it will work out what your trying to say in real time.\n- [Timer (by app cubby)](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/timer/id507518845?mt=8) - I use this app pretty much daily especially when cooking. Being able to have a huge range of timers setup ready to go especially on the iPhone 5 longer screen is awesome. I never let anything burn now and I can see multiple countdowns at a glance.\n- [Google Maps](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/google-maps/id585027354?mt=8) - The media made a big deal about the standard maps app for iOS 6 being a disaster. In my own experience I didn't find too many issues with it. But I found the smart design of the Google Maps app to be better. Being able to easily. Do fuzzy searches for directions and get quick estimates of drive times made me switch not long after launch.\n- [Launch Center Pro](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/launch-center-pro/id532016360?mt=8) - quick access to actions is the aim of this app, another from app cubby on my list. Being able to quickly toggle the brightness, open apps to certain actions like open the camera on Camera +, or making a hot dial to your partner.\n- [Checkmark](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/checkmark/id524873453?mt=8) - this is how the Reminders app for iOS should be. Having context of location is the best. I can setup reminders so next time I'm at the hardware store it will remind me to pick up the outdoor cleaner.\n- [Letterpress](https://itunes.apple.com/nz/app/letterpress-word-game/id526619424?mt=8) - this is the word game you want to play on iOS. My partner and I continually have a game in session. We're still not bored weeks after we first started playing.",

Chronicle lets you set up bills to pay, the amount and if they recur and sends notifications when they are due. My wife and I share the Dropbox syncing so we can both see what's outstanding and mark them off when paid. It just makes one of those annoyances of life (bills) easier to deal with and that's what technology is for.",

Just like web design trending in a more flat aesthetic to make responsive web design easier on multiple resolutions so to will having flat, texture less apps. It's even reflected in Apples new website, now that it's finally responsive. ((<a href=\"https://www.apple.com\">Apples new responsive website</a>))",

Having narrow sides I think will help you hold the phone with the longer length. I always liked the feel of my 3GS with its curved edges, much nicer to hold then the iPhone 4 and 5.\n\nThere aren’t any ground breaking changes (well maybe NFC) to the new iPhones, just good incremental changes as a whole. I think we’ve seen the last of new big hardware features. From now on the biggest improvements will be on software I believe. iOS 8 is actually what I’m more excited about, with its polished interface improvements and the inter app extensions.\n\n{% figure \"./iphone6-6plus-homescreens.jpg\", \"iPhone 6 & iPhone 6 Plus\" %}",

If battery life is your prime concern, the iPhone 6 Plus may very much be worth it with double the battery life for talk time of the 5S/5C. (([Apple iPhone comparison table](http://www.apple.com/nz/iphone/compare/)))\n\nAn interesting change to the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus is the exclusion of a 32GB model. Only 16, 64 and 128 phones are available, actually making the price points of the latter two quite attractive. Both iPhones are available to order on the 26th of September starting at NZD $999 for the iPhone 6 and $1149 for the iPhone 6 Plus.

It’s not unlike Apple to cannibalise their existing product markets, they have done it before with the iPod and iPod Nano. It will be interesting to see what improvements and features are added to the iPad later this year to justify its purchase.\n\n## Apple Watch\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"//www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ktujsc4ZUTo\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\nThe Apple Watch looks great!

Price may be a barrier for adoption with a RRP of USD $349 and more likely NZD $400+ which is pretty steep when compared with other smart watches already on sale.\n\nThe most important question is the battery life of the Apple Watch, even with the nice “magsafe” charger having a watch you have to remember to charge every night is a deal breaker for me and I’m sure a lot of others.\n\nIt will be interesting to see what more details are dropped before release, and what the final features will be. At the moment we have only a glimpse of a great looking mockup. I look forward to seeing the online configuration selection when it does become available, it will be a feat in itself to make it simple.",

This will bring up the recent images and gives you access to iCloud Drive, Photo Library and some other options. Simply select your file to upload and it will be transferred to your mac.\n\nFile transfers are extremely quick and there are no privacy concerns as it's direct on the same network.\n\nYou can also buy Panic's [Prompt 2 with Transmit for iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app-bundle/id926959558?mt=8&uo=4&at=10lnRx) which is as equally good, together as a bundle (saving you some money).",

A GUI template has all the UI elements painstakingly recreated in Sketch, to help you supplement your own designs.\n\nWe have two great choices thanks to [Meng To (of Design + Code)](https://designcode.io) and a large group at [Facebook](http://facebook.com/)</a>. Both provide extensive GUI templates of all the most common UI elements for free.\n\nMeng has create both an [iPhone](https://designcode.io/ios9) and [iPad](https://designcode.io/ios9-ipad) (including iPad Pro) GUI template in @1x resolution.",

But there is one downside on the free tier, your photos are compressed (not that you can tell) but none the less you can't download the proper originals.\n\nSo they say you should always have at least two backups, but how without having to sync your phone? Simple use CameraSync on iOS. It doesn't support SMB shares but it does support FTP which is pretty easy to setup.

Over time these move away from the original Sketch file with revisions over the life of the project/product.

Typically, this involves phone number and / or an email address.</blockquote>\nIf you haven't already set up 2 factor authentication on all your accounts I recommend you do so immediately.\n\nDealing with the fallout of a hacked account is too great a risk.

Slow component mounts, deep component trees, and unnecessary render cycles can quickly add up to an app that feels slow.\n> Luckily there are lots of tools, some even built in to React, that help with diagnosing performance issues. In this post I’ll highlight tools and techniques for making React apps fast. Each section also has an interactive, and (hopefully) fun demo!",

So from the get go my needs have been rather simple. I'd been put off buying a Philip Hue light kit as it requires its own hub and comes with a minimum of two bulbs.

The Lifx range support all the 3 of the most popular control systems, Apple Home kit, Goole Home and Amazon Alexa. While it had crossed my mind to use a Raspberry Pi to control home automation, I didn't want the hassle of setup.\n\n{% figure \"./lifx2-small.png\", \"Setup LIFX bulb\" %}\n\nThe process for setup was very easy, first set the bulb up by plugging it in to it's socket and switching the power on. Install the Lifx app on your phone and run through the set up wizard. Once that's done, you can update firmware and optionally set up like in my case for it to work with Homekit, by scanning the code that came with the device.\n\n{% figure \"./lifx1-small.png\", \"Apple Home\" %}",

You have to leave the light switch on for them to work and there is no easy way to turn the light on if you don't have a smart speaker in the room or you iPhone/mac/iPad handy. Ideally there needs to be a cheap, preferably hub-less, Homekit supporting switch, preferably that can hide the existing switch. I may have to investigate [this option](https://www.aqara.com/en/smart_hub-product.html) more.\n\nAs a side note I had originally ordered a [Kogeek Wifi enabled smart switch](https://www.koogeek.com/p-kh02.html) but unfortunately it was incompatible with my light wiring. I still think while having the need for an electrician to install, a smart light switch is a far better alternative than a smart bulb.",

WireGuard also offer a modern iOS app that offers easy On Demand activation with exceptions via [SSID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wi-Fi) when on WiFi. This is great to have the VPN only activate automatically on WiFi that is not your home setup.\n\nThe process for setup is documented on the [PiVPN](https://www.pivpn.io/#install) site and the interactive install makes the setup relatively easy. The only difficultly I found was trying to open the port on my router to the Pi on my local network. Entire setup for myself, including on devices was less than 30 mins. Applications are available for almost all platforms to install on your devices (phones, tablets & PCs) on the [WireGuard install page](https://www.wireguard.com/install/).",

We then loop through the rest of the array and update the smallest and largest variables if we find a smaller or larger number, respectively.

We then use the `Math.max()` function to find the largest number in the array, which is 87. Similarly, we use the `Math.min()` function to find the smallest number in the array, which is 1. Note that the `Math.max()` and `Math.min()` functions take a variable number of arguments, so we can pass an array as an argument and it will still work correctly.\n\n## Comparison 3 - Write Tests for Fizz Buzz\n\nLet's get the code assistants to do something very practical.

The result from CL was pretty poor in terms of being able to use right away. As a teaching tool it was helpful in explaining how you could test a JavaScript function detailing the install steps required to set up testing. But it embedded HTML encoded characters, meaning it could not be used right away. GC on the other hand returned some tests that could be used immediately, but the tests it did return were wrong for the context of the function. Three tests only worked if you had supplied a number to the function to test the results, it hadn't taken the context of the function we provided in to consideration (even though GC is supposed to be able to read the open files in VS Code).

We then define several individual tests that check different aspects of the function's behavior, such as whether it returns an array of the correct length, whether it correctly identifies multiples of 3 and 5, and whether it returns the number itself for all other numbers. Each test uses the `expect` function to make assertions about the output of the `getFizzBuzz` function.\n\n#### CodeLlama getFizzBuzz Tests Answer\n\n> To write tests for the `getFizzBuzz` function, we can use a testing framework such as Jest or Mocha. Here is an example of how to write tests using Jest:\n\n> 1. First, install Jest by running the following command in your terminal:\n\n```bash\nnpm install --save-dev jest\n```\n\n> 1. Next, create a new test file called `getFizzBuzz.test.js` in the same directory as your `getFizzBuzz` function.\n> 2. In this file, import Jest and the `getFizzBuzz` function:",

Write a test for each of the edge cases you identified earlier, such as testing that the function returns an empty array when given an empty array or a single number.\n> 2. For example, to test that the function returns an empty array when given an empty array, you could write the following test:\n\n```javascript\ntest(\"returns an empty array when given an empty array\", () => {\n  expect(getFizzBuzz([])).toStrictEqual([]);\n});\n```\n\n> 1. To test that the function returns the correct output for a single number, you could write the following test:\n\n```javascript\ntest(\"returns an array with the correct output for a single number\", () => {\n  expect(getFizzBuzz([1])).toStrictEqual([1]);\n});\n```",

If you haven't heard of Eleventy also known as 11ty it's a fast [Static Site Generator (SSG)](https://jamstack.org/generators/) that uses NodeS. It converts in my case Markdown files into a fast, easy to maintain blog that I've used since Jan 2021. As per usual upgrading to it was easy. So what's new?\n\n- ESM (ECMAScript Modules) support - so now you can use `import` and `export` in your templates!\n- It's smaller, has fewer dependencies, and is faster to install.\n- Plus a whole lot of other [goodies](https://github.com/11ty/eleventy/releases/tag/v3.0.0)",

Wireframes were then created in Excalidraw to visualize pages like home, sign up, course listings, and course details. Key requirements around authentication, data storage, roles and permissions were mapped out. Superbase was selected to provide authentication via LinkedIn/Google login as well as for it being a Postgres database. Next.js was chosen for its React framework and Radix UI was selected for accessible, customizable UI components to speed up development.\nogimage: \"build-a-full-stack-next-js-planning.jpg\"\n---",

This transcript has been lightly edited for length and clarity. In this stream I went over the planning stages of a project. First on a virtual whiteboard. I started with a brainstorm of ideas, then moved onto wireframes. Then circled back to start thinking about what features and functionality I would need to build the app. I also talked about the pros and cons of building a UI library from scratch or using something that is already pre-tested and available. Finally I went over the data structure and how I would store the data.\n\nTo view the Wireframes I created in the stream, please see the following link:\n[Wireframes on Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/#json=almP8vw8UnTN7cR6Zk6Xf,aIx7EgfHxXwpKKnv6k3IbQ)\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xhebsXoSn4",

This is part 7 of the series. I am continuing a project with an LMS (Learning Management System) using the Storybook.js, Superbase, and Radix UI. So far, I have set up a header component and am working on building other components in isolation using the storybook. The LMS project is in its early stages with a homepage set up and another page for listing data. The Superbase database is connected, with a few tables for courses and students. The next step is to work with Radix components.\n\nThe project is available on [GitHub as LMS NextJS](https://github.com/andrewjamesford/lms-nextjs).\n\nCheck out the [documentation on Radix UI](https://www.Radix-ui.com) components for more information.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXvU7F1D59o\n\n---\n\nAll right, hi there.\n\nI'm back.",

Andrew discusses how to display a list of courses on a webpage using data from a Supabase database. He explains how to use SQL queries to retrieve data from the database and display it on the webpage and also mentions using Superbase's table editor to edit the database and provides a brief overview of plans for future development.\nogimage: \"build-a-full-stack-next-js-supabase.jpg\"\n---\n\n{% figure \"./full-stack3.jpg\", \"&quot;A web full-stack app built with NextJS&quot; / Bing Image Creator\" %}",

This is the third video in the series where I use [Supabase](https://supabase.com) as the database for the app. In the video I create a table to hold our courses. I then load it with some data of some course names and then finally display the results of the data in a list.\n\nThe project is available on [GitHub as LMS NextJS](https://github.com/andrewjamesford/lms-nextjs).\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCnHOpg7U7s\n\n---\n\nAlright, hey there.\n\nOkay, so this stream is going to be on using Superbase.\n\nWe're going to continue on with the rest of the stream, I guess, with trying to build an XJS app from scratch.\n\nAnd we've gone through the planning stages already.",

I've barely run up any credit so far. Under $0.10, in fact it's very cheap.\n\n## How to use it?\n\nThis shortcut is flexible in that it can be used in multiple ways.

Install my [ChatGPT shortcut from here](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/34ad5973ed41401bab872a407e324da1) and click the \"Get Shortcut\" button\n3. Make sure you have signed in to the ChatGPT app (if not open it now and login)\n4. From the share sheet on an article on Safari scroll the page down to you come across the share action \"ChatGPT\" and tap it\n5. The shortcut will open a prompt asking \"What would you like ChatGPT to do?\"\n6. Enter a prompt of your own choosing, I like to use \"Summarize this article\" or \"Summarize this page\"\n7. The shortcut will show a loading icon and then display your answer in an alert box with a \"Done\" button\n8. The shortcut automatically copies the answer to your clipboard so you can paste it into another app\n\n{% figure \"./chatgpt-ios-shortcut.webp\", \"Using the shortcut to summarise an article\" %}",

It then gets your prompt from the input box that pops up. It then appends say the URL of a website to your prompt. For example I was on an article on [Stuff](https://i.stuff.co.nz/national/education/300847887/chatgpt-how-teachers-are-bringing-ai-tech-into-the-classroom) and this is what is passed to ChatGPT:\n\n```text\n\"Summarise this article\" +\nhttps://i.stuff.co.nz/...\n```\n\nThe shortcut then passes that to the action provided by the ChatGPT iOS app which returns the answer. The shortcut then displays the answer in an alert box and copies it to the clipboard.\n\n### Why should I use this shortcut?",

Say you have seen an article and you would like to summarise it.\n\nInstead of having to select and copy text to your clipboard which can be hard to do on a iPhone or iPad you can just tap the share sheet and select the ChatGPT shortcut. The shortcut will then perform what you prompt it to do.\n\nThe best part about this as this is you are using your logged in account in the ChatGPT app and can open the app and see the history of all the prompts you have made.

That has changed a lot in the last couple of years with some great new tools that allow much easier collaboration working on the same code base.\n\n## Live Share for Visual Studio Code\n\nA perfect choice for those that already use the extremely popular [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) from Microsoft is the [Live Share](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MS-vsliveshare.vsliveshare) extension. It allows you to share the code on your local PC with a link it copies to your clipboard.

It's even possible to share your terminal.\n\nWhile it may get the code sharing running up quickly it's only downside is to run the code locally you would have to setup the environment (installing Node or Python etc which may or may not be an issue).\n\n## Replit\n\nAnother option that allows screen sharing with nothing but a link and a browser is [Replit](https://replit.com/).

It's great for getting started quickly as it has a whole suite of templates for all sorts of projects including NodeJS, Python, Java, Ruby, Go, C#, ReactJS, Vue, and HTML/CSS. No stress about setting up the development environment, just select the appropriate template, run and share the link with your class.\n\nThe other benefit is the code can be forked easily. In the past I've used it for demos while teaching. Learners can take what you started with, fork (make another copy) and make changes to further their own learning in their own time. Of course they can share any changes after.",

You continually want to keep improving your teaching style and approach too. There are even times you will have to change tact with how you are teaching mid lesson. It definitely keeps you on your toes.\n\nThe biggest change I've found in my own well being is the feeling of satisfaction now with what I do in my job. While I did enjoy the developing of software, it's the lack of connection of your work to a customer/user that isn't great with the majority of jobs I've been at in the past.

The files are static and can't dynamically change like a Node.js or Wordpress website. So I needed a way to get the data from LastFM and display it on my site.

Serverless functions, also known as Functions As A Service, are a way of building and running computer programs without needing to worry about the underlying servers or infrastructure. Instead, a cloud provider takes care of managing the servers and resources, and developers can just write and deploy their code. Serverless functions are triggered by specific events or requests and can quickly execute and shut down when they're finished. This makes them efficient, cost-effective and flexible, and they're often used for tasks that don't require continuous running or need to handle a lot of traffic.\n\nTo be able to make a fetch request, I'm going to add the [Node fetch package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-fetch) to my project, so we can make a get request from the Last FM API to get the last played track for my account.",

I then pulled in my API key from the environment file that we created, and then you can see here we have a request with the API key added as a string literal. I then created a last track object and retrieved the appropriate details from the JSON data requested and finally returned the result.

In the age of TikTok, ChatGPT, and “TL;DR,” people want instant, relevant answers without wading through walls of text or scrubbing through 30-minute videos (which they’ll probably watch at 2x speed anyway).\n\nWhether reading a blog, seeking support, or navigating a product, attention is the new currency. But myself and most users are bankrupt. So I wanted to build something that respected people’s time: something that gets straight to the point and delivers value fast, with no fluff.\n\n## What Is RAG?\n\n**Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** is an AI pattern that combines two powerful components: a language model (like OpenAI's - gpt 4.1 nano) and a retrieval system. Instead of relying solely on the model’s training data, RAG actively fetches relevant documents from an external source like a blog, knowledge base, or docset and uses them to generate grounded responses.",

These are manually generated via a function in `generateVectorStore.mjs` and committed to the git repo.\n\nWhen someone asks a question, the system turns that query into a vector and compares it against the stored vectors to find the top matches. These are passed into the language model via LangChain to generate a tailored response.\n\n## Building the Chatbot UI\n\nTo keep things lightweight, I built the chatbot in plain **vanilla JavaScript and CSS**—no frameworks, no heavy dependencies.",

Using them too early in the course would require too much core knowledge and would be totally reliant on the engineer (knowledgeable other) to help build the project. At the end of the course, they have covered all the core knowledge over previous terms and can quite easily make a small web app with authorisation and implement an API with database write and read functionality.

In the `pages/api/` folder create a new file `checkout_sessions.js`. Add the following to this file:\n\n```js\nconst stripe = require(\"stripe\")(process.env.STRIPE_SECRET_KEY);",

Let's first install via the terminal:\n\n```shell\nnpm install --save @stripe/stripe-js\n```\n\nOnce that's been added we can then add the following to the `index.js` file to create a Stripe object.

Will my website have good [SEO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine_optimization)? Very quickly you can be overloaded with decisions. This stems mostly from the fact that React is not a framework. It's a _library_.",

With it a lot of the decisions have been made for you, letting you get up and running much faster. More importantly it solves a lot of the common problems that building a website/web app entail.\n\nYou will need to have an understanding of HTML, CSS and React of course to follow along with this series. I teach all these subjects at [Developers Institute](https://www.developers.ac.nz) where I'm a Tech Lead 😉\n\nTo get started building a Next.js application, hopefully you have Node installed ( if not [download here](https://nodejs.org/en/) ) and open up your terminal.\n\n```shell\nnpx create-next-app@latest\n```\n\nFollow the prompts and give it a name \"shop-nextjs-stripe\"\n\nHead into the directory with your new project and start the local development.\n\n```shell\ncd shop-nextjs-stripe\nnpm run dev\n```",

You will see 3 folders. The \"pages\" folder is where the routing happens. That will direct the url page in your app. For example if you had a file called `contact-us.js` to be routed to it you would have the following url your browser `http://localhost:3000/contact-us`. This will show the content from that component.\n\nYour **pages** folder will have a **api** folder and two files `_app.js` and `index.js`.\n\nOpen the project in a [browser](http://localhost:3000) and you should see something like this\n\n{% image \"./nextjs-start.png\", \"Next.JS Starter\" %}\n\nGreat the project is up and running in development mode 🙌",

Time to make our first component. Let's make a new folder called `components` and add a file `layout.js` in that directory. Add the following:\n\n```jsx\nimport React from \"react\";\nimport Head from \"next/head\";\n\nimport styles from \"../styles/layout.module.css\";",

To add to that we will add a Header and a Footer component.\n\nAgain in the `components` folder create a `header.js` and a `footer.js` file.\n\nIn the header file add the following:\n\n```jsx\nimport React from \"react\";\n\nexport const Header = () => {\n  return <header></header>;\n};\n```\n\nIn the footer file add the following:\n\n```jsx\nimport React from \"react\";\n\nexport const Footer = () => {\n  return <footer></footer>;\n};\n```\n\nWe need to update the layout component like so (see the comments in the code):",

By default Next.js supports CSS modules, the major benefit with CSS modules is we can avoid CSS name collisions (it makes unique CSS class names) and feel comfortable to delete an unused CSS file as we know it's only relevant to one component. [CSS Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/css-modules-part-1-need/) has a series on CSS Modules worth reading to get a better understanding.\n\nNotice that the corresponding CSS classes above are referenced as a JavaScript object e.g.\n\n```jsx\n<div className={styles.container}>\n```\n\nLet's add the CSS and it's file.

The app will function in the same way but look different for each corresponding theme with alternate fonts, colours and logo etc. This can be a big headache, and you can be left maintaining multiple copies of the same code base. In an ideal world we don't want to do that.",

I needed to use the same code base for this ReactJS app. Most importantly I needed to have flexibility and have options to hide and show form fields, components etc if needed for different themes. I also wanted to have an easy way to switch which theme/brand the app was using across the board at the deployment level. So same GIT repository, 3 different deployments (domains), all hosted on Azure.\n\nAt work we use [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) which is a utility first CSS framework. Rather than making custom CSS classes for each part of a component you are working on, you add multiple utility classes to each element and never run the issue of another developer (or your self in the future) breaking your design. CSS classes stay consistent and in practise I've found you only need to add on the off occasion a custom CSS class.",

So anywhere through out the application I can prefix the brand name and a colon to a CSS class for example and know it will only be shown for that theme. Just like when using the [responsive classes in Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/responsive-design).\n\n```jsx\n<div className=\"alpha:bg-alpha-color1 beta:bg-beta-color1 gamma:bg-gamma-color1 text-sm\">\n  My component\n</div>\n```",

Stopping a developer from needing to switch contexts and having to look up documentation (Peng et al., 2023)[^3].\n- Generating tests: When writing code for software development, it is best practice to write tests to ensure your code is working correctly. Often this can be a mind-numbing task doing simple checks to ensure that when two known values are passed to a function, the expected results are always the same every time the function is run. You can ensure this is the case by writing tests (small pieces of code to check) that test the boundaries of happy and negative paths. Copilot is integrated into your IDE, so it is aware of your code's functions. It knows the expected parameters and can generate these small tests, saving lots of time on repetitive coding (Wermelinger, 2023)[^4].",

It’s tailored for ChatGPT and Codex CLI for now, but other tools are adopting similar formats. For GitHub Copilot, I use a workaround—creating an instructions.md file that points to AGENTS.md.\n\nOnce that’s in place, I start expanding on the task in detail. Examples help massively. Through iterative conversations with the agent, I get most of the way there without having to read the code line by line. It’s the kind of work I can do while watching YouTube or multitasking.

It lets you style your HTML content by appending a multitude of predefined utility CSS classes to your HTML elements. For example say you were creating a Card component with a heading, description and image using ReactJS.\n\n```jsx\nconst Card = ({ heading, description, image }) => {\n  return (\n    <div className=\"cardContainer\">\n      <img src={image} className=\"cardImage\" alt=\"\" />\n      <div>\n        <h3 className=\"cardHeading\">{heading}</h3>\n        <div className=\"cardDescription\">{description}</div>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  );\n};\n```",

This would require us to create these individual classes in a CSS file. In this scenario there are two things that need to be done:\n\n1. Name our CSS class names: Naming can be difficult, especially when multiple team members are involved. It can lead to confusion, for example, if one person refers to a component as a \"tile\" and another calls it a \"card.\"\n2. Duplication: Repeating the same CSS properties multiple times throughout the CSS file(s) e.g. `margin: 0` and `padding: 1rem` we can end up with a mess that most developers on your team would be afraid to change for fear of regression issues.",

Initially it's a shock to see such a mess of CSS classes for each HTML element. But each class is easy to remember as they map to existing CSS properties, and will not be repeated in the CSS file.\n\n```jsx\nconst Card = ({ heading, description, image }) => {\n  return (\n    <div className=\"rounded-xl shadow-lg bg-white p-4 mb-4 flex gap-2\">\n      <img src={image} className=\"rounded-lg\" alt=\"\" />\n      <div>\n        <h3 className=\"font-bold\">{heading}</h3>\n        <div className=\"font-serif\">{description}</div>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  );\n};\n```\n\n## Why should I use Tailwind CSS?",

By default, you don't have naming conflicts and there are no confusion about names as styling is done at the property level.\n- The use of the Tailwind Labs official plugin for [VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bradlc.vscode-tailwindcss) enable autocomplete functionality. If you already know the name of CSS properties and have used the likes of [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2/utilities/spacing/#margin-and-padding) for padding and margin you will quickly feel familiar with Tailwind.\n- Another benefit is that you aren't changing the CSS, instead you are working on the HTML so there is little chance of breaking styling for other parts of your website.\n- You will only have to do a minimal amount of CSS work for the likes of theming or specific custom styles which means your CSS won't grow in size much at all. In fact with the build process your HTML can be scanned to look for the CSS classes and determine if they are not used and can be removed from the CSS file of the website. Therefore only creating a CSS file with the CSS classes used.\n- As the padding and margin values are predefined you won't get the same padding value declared multiple times scattered through your CSS file. You can also check at a glance are elements sharing the same padding or margin by the CSS classes applied without having to use the browser dev tools or find the class in the CSS.\n- No need to write media queries as instead you can use the [utility classes outlined here](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/responsive-design) in the vein of `md:w-32` to only apply the CSS class on the page being **medium** sized.",

Establishing a consistent design system using CSS can be a time-consuming process. It requires a solid understanding of CSS as well as strong communication skills to establish a process and create a style guide that all team members must adhere to, instead of relying on \"janky\" CSS hacks for the desired look from StackOverflow.\n\nTailwind CSS can simplify the documentation process by providing comprehensive documentation and resources for getting started, both from the official [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation) developers and the [community](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ft30zcMlFao). This can make it easier to understand and implement.\n\n## What are the downsides of Tailwind CSS?",

        "pageContent": "- File size: Tailwind requires a large number of CSS classes to be added to your HTML, which can lead to longer page load times and larger file sizes if not optimized properly.\n- Learning curve: Tailwind CSS requires a different approach to writing CSS, which can take some time to learn and adjust to.\n- Opinionated design: Tailwind CSS provides pre-defined classes that can be used to quickly style elements, but it also imposes a specific design aesthetic that may not align with the desired look and feel of the website or application.\n- Overuse of classes: Using too many classes on a single element can make the HTML difficult to read and understand, leading to a more complex and harder to maintain codebase.\n- Customization: Tailwind CSS is highly customizable, but this can also lead to increased complexity in terms of configuration, and can make it harder to maintain the design consistency across the project.\n- Hard to remove: It can be challenging to remove Tailwind CSS once it has been implemented. This is because the embedded Tailwind classes are present throughout your HTML, component, or template files, and removing them incrementally can create conflicts with the Tailwind build system. Additionally, it may further complicate the project by requiring an additional build process for the new setup to incrementally replace styling.\n- Waiting on bleeding edge CSS features: Recent years have seen significant advancements in browser CSS capabilities, such as [Container Queries](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Container_Queries), `:has()`, and [Subgrid](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout/Subgrid). While these features can enhance the design and functionality of a website, they can be difficult to implement using Tailwind. In some cases, it may be necessary to wait for them to become available in Tailwind or make changes to the implementation once they are supported.\n- Native is forever: When incorporating a new framework like Tailwind into a project, it will require a learning phase. However, it's important to note that the knowledge acquired is specific to the Tailwind framework, including its class names and naming conventions, which may not be transferable to other frameworks. On the other hand, using CSS in its native form and understanding its intended use will result in a knowledge that will remain useful for a long time.\n- Bare-bones by default: What makes Tailwind different to other frameworks like Bootstrap etc is that you will need to create basic components like footers and headers from scratch, unless you pay for [TailwindUI](https://tailwindui.com). These prebuilt components are not freely available as open source. Instead most build there own components from scratch using the Tailwind CSS classes.",

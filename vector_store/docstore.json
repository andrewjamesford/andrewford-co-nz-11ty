There are a couple of benefits for this approach:\n\n1. The page weight is usually smaller, and the site doesn't require multiple http requests (it shouldn't anyway if your using image sprites)\n1. The elements can easily grow and shrink to fit content without having to resort to techniques like \"sliding doors\"\n1.

This can be done in a multitude of ways:\n\n- Via referencing a JavaScript file\n- A library as part of a build process\n- An application to process the LESS files independent of programming language\n- Using a plugin in your IDE\n\n## Using LESS.js to compile your LESS","metadata":{"source":"/Users/andrewford/Developer/Blog/andrewford-co-nz-11ty/content/archive/2012-04-27-css-programmable-stylesheet-language/index.md","loc":{"lines":{"from":18,"to":27}}}}],["ffe99d2b-e3dc-4248-b82f-1d0bf1b20578",{"pageContent":"## Using LESS.js to compile your LESS\n\nI can't say I've ever used this method.

It's implementation is also extremely easy (and it works with both MVC and WinForm projects).

It allows importing from other folders, processing of many other CSS dynamic languages and the minification and combining of files. Other applications of note are SimpLESS which is multi-platform, and LESS app for Mac by the same developer as CodeKit. If you are just starting out I'd recommend CodeKit to start with, it's easier to setup and independent of the language your developing on also it will notify you of errors when compiling the LESS to CSS.

Other frameworks of mention are [Elements](http://lesselements.com/) and my own set of mixins [LESS Mixing](https://github.com/andrewjamesford/lessmixing).\n\n## Further Reading","metadata":{"source":"/Users/andrewford/Developer/Blog/andrewford-co-nz-11ty/content/archive/2012-04-27-css-programmable-stylesheet-language/index.md","loc":{"lines":{"from":51,"to":55}}}}],["43e52879-9e47-4c7a-9431-715b8ca8b592",{"pageContent":"## Further Reading\n\n- [LESS CSS](http://lesscss.org)\n- [Tuts+ Get into LESS](http://webdesign.tutsplus.com/tutorials/htmlcss-tutorials/get-into-less-the-programmable-stylesheet-language/)\n- [Learn LESS](http://www.12devsofxmas.co.uk/2011/12/less/)\n- [Apps on Mac for CSS pre-processing](http://mac.appstorm.net/roundups/internet-roundup/5-mac-apps-that-make-css-preprocessors-easier-to-use/)\n- [Mindscape Web Workbench](http://www.mindscapehq.com/products/web-workbench)\n- [SquishIt on github](https://github.com/jetheredge/SquishIt)","metadata":{"source":"/Users/andrewford/Developer/Blog/andrewford-co-nz-11ty/content/archive/2012-04-27-css-programmable-stylesheet-language/index.md","loc":{"lines":{"from":55,"to":62}}}}],["7c05b507-2e79-4f50-bb97-947f125eb458",{"pageContent":"---\ntitle: \"Time validation in ASP.Net MVC using a regular expression.\"\ndate: \"2012-05-15T12:52:32+00:00\"\ntemplate: post\ndraft: false\nslug: \"/2012/05/15/time-validation-asp-net-mvc-regular-expression/\"\ncategory: \"article\"\ntags:\n  - .Net\ndescription: \"Just a quick tip for Time validation in ASP.Net MVC for your data model using a regular expression.\"\n---\n\nJust a quick tip for Time validation in ASP.Net MVC for your data model using a regular expression.\n\nPlace the following in your model:\n\n```c#\n[DisplayFormat(ApplyFormatInEditMode = true,\nDataFormatString = &quot;{0:HH:mm}&quot;)]\n[RegularExpression(@&quot;^(?:0?[0-9]|1[0-9]|2[0-3]):[0-5][0-9]$&quot;, ErrorMessage = &quot;Invalid time.&quot;)]\npublic DateTime?

Backed with some great editing tools it's a great photography app to have on your phone.\n\n## [Yahoo Weather](https://itunes.apple.com/nz/app/yahoo-weather/id628677149?mt=8&uo=4&at=10lnRx)\n\n{% figure \"./icon-yahoo-weather.jpg\", \"Yahoo Weather Icon\" %}","metadata":{"source":"/Users/andrewford/Developer/Blog/andrewford-co-nz-11ty/content/archive/2014-08-27-iphone-home-screen-august-2014/index.md","loc":{"lines":{"from":32,"to":40}}}}],["96dfff63-2747-4e82-b542-ea47bca66233",{"pageContent":"## [Yahoo Weather](https://itunes.apple.com/nz/app/yahoo-weather/id628677149?mt=8&uo=4&at=10lnRx)\n\n{% figure \"./icon-yahoo-weather.jpg\", \"Yahoo Weather Icon\" %}\n\nWhat I like about the Yahoo weather app is the stunning photos of locations.

We then loop through the rest of the array and update the smallest and largest variables if we find a smaller or larger number, respectively. Finally, we print out the smallest and largest numbers.\n\n#### CodeLlama Array Answer\n\n> To find the largest and smallest numbers in an array of 1-100 in JavaScript, you can use the `Math.max()` function to find the largest number and the `Math.min()` function to find the smallest number. Here is an example code:","metadata":{"source":"/Users/andrewford/Developer/Blog/andrewford-co-nz-11ty/content/articles/ai-assisted-coding-tools-codellama-vs-github-copilot-chat/index.md","loc":{"lines":{"from":193,"to":217}}}}],["e2500a3d-1c8e-489a-b192-1c3e0ebed9b3",{"pageContent":"```javascript\nconst numbers = [34, 23, 87, 100, 1];\nconsole.log(Math.max(...numbers)); // Output: 87\nconsole.log(Math.min(...numbers)); // Output: 1\n```\n\n> In this code, we first define an array of numbers called `numbers`. We then use the `Math.max()` function to find the largest number in the array, which is 87. Similarly, we use the `Math.min()` function to find the smallest number in the array, which is 1. Note that the `Math.max()` and `Math.min()` functions take a variable number of arguments, so we can pass an array as an argument and it will still work correctly.\n\n## Comparison 3 - Write Tests for Fizz Buzz\n\nLet's get the code assistants to do something very practical.

This time CL took an age to return a result in comparison to GC. The result from CL was pretty poor in terms of being able to use right away. As a teaching tool it was helpful in explaining how you could test a JavaScript function detailing the install steps required to set up testing. But it embedded HTML encoded characters, meaning it could not be used right away. GC on the other hand returned some tests that could be used immediately, but the tests it did return were wrong for the context of the function. Three tests only worked if you had supplied a number to the function to test the results, it hadn't taken the context of the function we provided in to consideration (even though GC is supposed to be able to read the open files in VS Code). In this situation both were a bust.","metadata":{"source":"/Users/andrewford/Developer/Blog/andrewford-co-nz-11ty/content/articles/ai-assisted-coding-tools-codellama-vs-github-copilot-chat/index.md","loc":{"lines":{"from":253,"to":256}}}}],["4fc07263-89b0-4f71-877b-439707ee5d65",{"pageContent":"| Assistant               | Time to content | Rating |\n| ----------------------- | --------------- | ------ |\n| GitHub Copilot (GC)     | 3s              | 3/5    |\n| Continue/CodeLlama (CL) | 19s             | 2/5    |\n\n### GitHub Copilot getFizzBuzz Tests Answer\n\n> Sure, here's an example of how you could write tests to test the `getFizzBuzz` function using the Jest testing framework in JavaScript:\n\n```javascript\nconst getFizzBuzz = require(\"./index\");\n\ndescribe(\"getFizzBuzz\", () => {\n  it(\"should return an array of length 100\", () => {\n    const result = getFizzBuzz();\n    expect(result).toHaveLength(100);\n  });\n\n  it('should return \"Fizz\" for multiples of 3', () => {\n    const result = getFizzBuzz();\n    for (let i = 2; i < result.length; i += 3) {\n      expect(result[i]).toBe(\"Fizz\");\n    }\n  });","metadata":{"source":"/Users/andrewford/Developer/Blog/andrewford-co-nz-11ty/content/articles/ai-assisted-coding-tools-codellama-vs-github-copilot-chat/index.md","loc":{"lines":{"from":258,"to":281}}}}],["a42581cc-773e-471d-8dd0-47574270f079",{"pageContent":"it('should return \"Fizz\" for multiples of 3', () => {\n    const result = getFizzBuzz();\n    for (let i = 2; i < result.length; i += 3) {\n      expect(result[i]).toBe(\"Fizz\");\n    }\n  });\n\n  it('should return \"Buzz\" for multiples of 5', () => {\n    const result = getFizzBuzz();\n    for (let i = 4; i < result.length; i += 5) {\n      expect(result[i]).toBe(\"Buzz\");\n    }\n  });\n\n  it('should return \"Fizz Buzz\" for multiples of both 3 and 5', () => {\n    const result = getFizzBuzz();\n    for (let i = 14; i < result.length; i += 15) {\n      expect(result[i]).toBe(\"Fizz Buzz\");\n    }\n  });\n\n  it(\"should return the number itself for all other numbers\", () => {\n    const result = getFizzBuzz();\n    for (let i = 0; i < result.length; i++) {\n      if (i % 3 !== 0 && i % 5 !== 0) {\n        expect(result[i]).toBe(i + 1);\n      }\n    }\n  });\n});\n```","metadata":{"source":"/Users/andrewford/Developer/Blog/andrewford-co-nz-11ty/content/articles/ai-assisted-coding-tools-codellama-vs-github-copilot-chat/index.md","loc":{"lines":{"from":276,"to":306}}}}],["81f9e201-339f-4b03-96af-2787a120278e",{"pageContent":"> In this example, we use Jest to define a test suite for the `getFizzBuzz` function.

Sure enough everything worked as expected. I removed the upgrade helper plugin and did a little tidy up switching syntax from commonjs to esm (es6/es2015) and pushed the branch to test the preview build (got to love Netlify's setup). The preview build looked good too, so I merged it into main. All done and dusted in under an hour.

Next.js.\n\nAnd so the whole idea is to make an app from scratch using Next.js.\n\nWe're going to use Superbase for the database, and we're going to go through the whole planning process and getting everything ready together, and go over some of the theory, of course, of why we should do things the way I am showing you.\n\nOf course, open to suggestions, not the VLN handle.\n\nThis is just one way to do it.\n\nSo let's just jump into it, I think.\n\nSo today's stream is going to be working on the design of a database.\n\nSo not actually building it as such in any code or anything like that.\n\ngoing to use a tool called DB diagram and we're going to use that to help us design the database that we're going to put together for our LMS and we have a super base.\n\nOkay let's jump

that.","metadata":{"source":"/Users/andrewford/Developer/Blog/andrewford-co-nz-11ty/content/articles/build-a-full-stack-next-js-db-design/index.md","loc":{"lines":{"from":29,"to":55}}}}],["faa7e45d-4075-4d05-af13-d3f4293526aa",{"pageContent":"Okay

used this many times in the past.\n\nI'm sure many of my past students remember going through using this.\n\nBut it basically allows you to draw entity relationship diagrams in a nice little web tool and we'll just start getting into it I think.\n\nSo let's sort of think back and sort of cast our minds back to what we've done previously.\n\nSo we have created a table for Superbase and it's sitting here in the Table Editor and we've got a courses table.\n\nOK, so this is basically a table that we started last stream, which was about two weeks ago now.\n\nAnd in it we have a name and a description and an image for the course.\n\nand we can ID.\n\nSo we can use that as one of the part of the design that we're going to be working

straight to DPDiagram and sort of get our heads in the game about how we're going to design this database.\n\nOkay so it's got a pretty simple format, you log in, you can use github login which is handy of course not having to create another account again and it's got like a basic demo here and it's talking about a product category and a product image and it's a nice sort of starting block there and it shows sort of the relationship here between these three tables So these are not the tables that we're going to use, but this is a good place to start so that we can sort of see how the tool works.\n\nSo the tool is very much a.\n\nit's a representation of the database's tables and those relationships between them.","metadata":{"source":"/Users/andrewford/Developer/Blog/andrewford-co-nz-11ty/content/articles/build-a-full-stack-next-js-db-design/index.md","loc":{"lines":{"from":75,"to":87}}}}],["069b44ab-2e70-4f68-b1cc-edc2ede7ab70",{"pageContent":"So

and so we've got the courses table which is what I was showing before.\n\nSo we can have a table, you don't need to know so much the syntax for this, it does have a bit of help here in the documentation.\n\nbut you can get along pretty far just by sort of following the examples.\n\nOkay so give it a table name.\n\nSo this isn't SQL as such, it's just a language that's used for the

some of the next page there.\n\nSo let's go back to our diagram.\n\nSo we've got a table, we've got courses.\n\nNext one I was showing before in the UI for Superbase.\n\nAgain it's a very sort of simple sort of markup kind of language.\n\nSo you've got the table name using a plural there for courses.\n\nAnd I need to have an ID.\n\nSo I'm going to have a course ID.\n\nThis is going to be a integer.\n\nSo let's make sure that we do that the correct way.\n\nSo it's an integer like that, int.\n\nAnd we can have the primary key there.\n\nThat's what the PK stands for.\n\nSo if we go like that.","metadata":{"source":"/Users/andrewford/Developer/Blog/andrewford-co-nz-11ty/content/articles/build-a-full-stack-next-js-db-design/index.md","loc":{"lines":{"from":105,"to":145}}}}],["65f01e75-54c5-4d09-a74d-15103a59243d",{"pageContent":"So

got a little key icon there for the cross ID.\n\nSo that's very much like what we've got for our existing table here.\n\nSo the next field in there is a created at.\n\nAgain, created it and this is going to be a timestamp.\n\nI believe that's the right type.\n\nSo timestamp, whenever a row is added to this table, it's going to get the timestamp placed on it and so that we know when that record

the ref there pointing to the other table.\n\nOr you can use for the likes of a many to one relationship.","metadata":{"source":"/Users/andrewford/Developer/Blog/andrewford-co-nz-11ty/content/articles/build-a-full-stack-next-js-db-design/index.md","loc":{"lines":{"from":347,"to":365}}}}],["e23d9a1d-809c-4cb5-bd83-fa3c664b8818",{"pageContent":"So

and you can see here it's very similar syntax, it's just that it's got a square brackets around that.\n\nOkay so let's grab this one, we don't really need the first part of it but basically we have, we're going to have a very much a one-to-many.\n\nSo let's think about this.\n\nLet's look at this diagram and get a sort of head around this.\n\nSo it's saying we've got a many-to-one relationship.\n\nOkay so in the code here it's got a reference here, many-to-one like so.\n\nOkay so we could have the same.\n\nSo we could have our course ID like so.\n\nAnd so there's a couple of two different ways that you can see that I've done this.\n\nSo now it's representing that sort of link between the two.\n\nSo I've just dragged between one to the other.\n\nIt's around the wrong

course ID, it's going to have many sections.\n\nSo the course ID here, this is not going to be a primary key, there's going to be multiple versions that will be same course ID for all the different

write this up, anyway there's nothing stopping you from doing that kind of beauty of this tool is that you know you've got a GUI for when you want to use it and you've also got a quite nice markup language that's easy to share.\n\nAnother good thing about this having it be all sort of a markup language that's not specific you can actually this is this is independent of database it is.\n\nSo in the case of our project we are using Superbase which is basically a hosted Postgres database.\n\nSo we can make it export this to some Postgres SQL or flavor of Postgres SQL but this dbml language is actually to the database agnostic so we could maybe even export the same thing for the links of MySQL or Microsoft SQL as well I

maybe we have an error log in our application and we could actually then draw back through the created at records there.\n\nSo we might be able to see if there was an issue there with that table that could give us some insight there.\n\nTo that, we've got auditing.\n\nSo a big thing about a lot of apps and the like is it's very helpful to know when something happened or something was

that remember is with databases and the like, we try to make our data so that it can easily be updated or changed.\n\nIt's common these days for people if they get married or in a civil union etc they may change their last name so it would be annoying if you had to repeat the first name and last name on all the comments so that when that user updates their details, then we'd have to go into

a Students progress table, I think I think that's what we'll call it Table students progress Okay, so this is going to record like I said The student the course that they're on and what section that they are up to okay, so Good thing for this is we probably can get away with the one record per student per course and that way we should be fine in that regards to just track that.\n\nSo we can do,

This is part 5 of the series. In it we start further planning and using a kanban board to track our progress. To do this we use GitHub projects and generate a board and create some issues/tickets to build. We also start building out the components for the project.\n\nThe project is available on [GitHub as LMS NextJS](https://github.com/andrewjamesford/lms-nextjs).\n\nThe GitHub project board is

part, in the project itself, we had a router.\n\nOkay.\n\nAnd in that router, we had a courses page.\n\nLet's see if that's still working actually.\n\nThis courses.\n\nWhat's the route?\n\nLet's see if that works.\n\nOkay.\n\nSo, I've got my data.\n\nIt doesn't look like it'll be breaking, which is probably a good thing.\n\nBut it's not loading anything because we've got no data there.\n\nThat's fine.\n\nWe'll get to that in a sec.\n\nThinking about the actual project in its entirety.\n\nWhat are the key things, I guess, that anything, any sort of project needs?\n\nIn a lot of time, it'll be something, you know, the basics.\n\nSo we've created a database that we can use in our project.\n\nWe've got the foundations, I guess, for the actual React app itself.\n\nSo that's using Next.js.","metadata":{"source":"/Users/andrewford/Developer/Blog/andrewford-co-nz-11ty/content/articles/build-a-full-stack-next-js-github-project/index.md","loc":{"lines":{"from":277,"to":323}}}}],["bf11b871-c624-4768-b611-3eca2f33b112",{"pageContent":"So

we're going to have students sign up, of course, and they're going to have to have some way to do that.\n\nSo coming in, back to the Kanban board, we can look at it.\n\nAnd a pretty common thing that you probably need is a sign up page.\n\nOkay, we need a login page.\n\nOkay, what else are we going to need?\n\nWe're going to sign up, we're going to log in, essentially a forgot password.\n\nThinking about all the sort of permutations of what's actually going to be required there.\n\nSign up page, login page, forgot password, what else are we going to need?\n\nAnything else

actually be calling these routes rather than pages.\n\nSo that we can route the user where they are needed rather than.\n\nOkay, so we can edit the title.\n\nYeah, forgot password route.\n\nSo these are not the components themselves.\n\nThis is what I'm thinking of in terms of the routing, in terms of the XJS.\n\nBecause we need a way to get to the components that we're going to be seeing.\n\nAnd we need to be able to actually navigate that, of course, from a URL.\n\nAnd why do we do this?\n\nWell, there's a couple of good things.\n\nWhy we actually set up all these routes and the like.\n\nSo a good thing about any sort of website, it's a really good idea to think about all the routes in terms of your HTML is something that you can actually pass off to another application.","metadata":{"source":"/Users/andrewford/Developer/Blog/andrewford-co-nz-11ty/content/articles/build-a-full-stack-next-js-github-project/index.md","loc":{"lines":{"from":345,"to":377}}}}],["b5f103d8-1e35-4758-a300-13f0ad618917",{"pageContent":"So a good thing about any sort of website, it's a really good idea to think about all the routes in terms of your HTML is something that you can actually pass off to another application.\n\nThe great thing about links is you can embed them in, say, a message, or you can embed them in an email.\n\nWhen a user clicks on those, the user would be redirected to that part on the website.\n\nAnd it's better than, I guess, having stage controlling all the different routes.\n\nInstead, we can use the URL, which is something that stays the same in this, in the actual sort of URL bar in a browser, and take advantage of that to hold our state of where the actual user has navigated to.\n\nAnd that's probably a key thing about websites is that they have this inbuilt state there, this really clever process of the URL.\n\nVery simplistic, but really powerful when you think about what you can do with a URL in terms of being able to direct someone to do something.","metadata":{"source":"/Users/andrewford/Developer/Blog/andrewford-co-nz-11ty/content/articles/build-a-full-stack-next-js-github-project/index.md","loc":{"lines":{"from":377,"to":389}}}}],["756e7f51-fc65-43b9-95c8-df4c0434e353",{"pageContent":"Very

so that's obviously the project number 4 that's been created.\n\nAnd you've even got like a view there, it's got like an identifier of one, and it's actually even got some parameters there.\n\nSo before we change some of these, we may actually, let's see what happens to our state.\n\nWe should get some changes.\n\nYeah, so now we don't see the actual issue itself.\n\nOnce we click on it, we can see the issue, we can see the item ID.\n\nIf I click on to some of these others, of course the ID changes.\n\nSo very powerful, I think, a

don't think about a lot, but it's really important to think about it in terms of you'd be able to send someone an email to say, hey, you forgot your password.\n\nSo when you go for that whole process of a forgot password route, then we can actually get them to go to the direct form that they need to go to, maybe to reset that password.\n\nAnd it's all at all at really important parts of building web applications.\n\nOkay, so we've got a signup page, I've got a logon page route, I've got a forgot password route, I've got a new password route.\n\nSo these are the actual routes themselves.\n\nSo

see the project itself.\n\nOkay, so this is my last sort of changes I did from last night around the ERD diagram.\n\nSo I've got a link there to dbdiagram.io and the markdown file.\n\nAnd I've got a

you're going to want to start with the same category.\n\nSo, you're going to want to start with the same category.\n\nOkay, it's going to have a Nav component.\n\nWe're also going to need something

planning stages and a good place probably to start is this login page route.\n\nWhat I can do, we're going to need a header anyway.\n\nGoing back to Excalidraw and our designs here.\n\nSo, we've got the header following the user all the way through from the links of the homepage, the signup page, login page, course overview, course detail.\n\nSo, again, this is a component that we're going to use throughout the actual application.\n\nSo, it's a good place probably to start with that login page because then we can actually then start showing the user to be signed in.\n\nThere'll probably be some sort of way to show the user that they are logged in or not.\n\nMaybe to get to settings that they want to have for their specific user.\n\nDo they want a light mode or dark mode or something

just to show that when someone's logged in they know who they're logged in as and it's obvious to the user.\n\nOkay, so sitting in my backlog, it's not sitting in the do, that means it's not, it

brainstorming ideas on a virtual whiteboard. Wireframes were then created in Excalidraw to visualize pages like home, sign up, course listings, and course details. Key requirements around authentication, data storage, roles and permissions were mapped out. Superbase was selected to provide authentication via LinkedIn/Google login as well as for it being a Postgres database. Next.js was chosen for its React framework and Radix UI was selected for accessible, customizable UI components to speed up development.\nogimage: \"full-stack1.jpg\"\n---","metadata":{"source":"/Users/andrewford/Developer/Blog/andrewford-co-nz-11ty/content/articles/build-a-full-stack-next-js-planning/index.md","loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":17}}}}],["48bdca60-426f-4b54-8e05-f444aaa1d2cd",{"pageContent":"{% figure \"./full-stack1.jpg\", \"&quot;A web full-stack app built with NextJS&quot; / Bing Image Creator\" %}\n\nThe following is a transcript of my live stream on YouTube Sep 14, 2023 on Dev Containers in VS Code. This transcript has been lightly edited for length and clarity. In this stream I went over the planning stages of a project. First on a virtual whiteboard. I started with a brainstorm of ideas, then moved onto wireframes. Then circled back to start thinking about what features and functionality I would need to build the app. I also talked about the pros and cons of building a UI library from scratch or using something that is already pre-tested and available.

into the documentation.\n\nEnterprise, single sign on, social login.\n\nYes, okay so we've got LinkedIn, we've got Google, we've got Microsoft, whereas you're using Slack, which actually, that could

fact that Superbase actually also has a quite nice editing tool that's all web-based as well.\n\nSo you can administer your site I guess while you're in that sort of early stages before you have I guess a full-blown actual interface there that people would be able to manage content in.\n\nLike I said in the whiteboarding here, let's try and keep it down to the minimum

editor.\n\nSo I've technically got a very basic admin that I can use at least to get started to be able to add content, to add videos and sort of get started there, which is pretty cool.\n\nAnd another normal thing that anyone will question of course is price.\n\nalways a good question to sort of ask.\n\nLet's look at pricing here.\n\nWe've got a zero dollar.\n\nLooks like it's social auth

This is part 7 of the series. I am continuing a project with an LMS (Learning Management System) using the Storybook.js, Superbase, and Radix UI. So far, I have set up a header component and am working on building other components in isolation using the storybook. The LMS project is in its early stages with a homepage set up and another page for listing data. The Superbase database is connected, with a few tables for courses and students. The next step is to work with Radix components.\n\nThe project is available on [GitHub as LMS NextJS](https://github.com/andrewjamesford/lms-nextjs).\n\nCheck out the [documentation on Radix UI](https://www.Radix-ui.com) components for more information.\n\nyoutube.com/embed/EXvU7F1D59o?si=8kM1Zl-k5_MIjtDG\n\n---\n\nAll right, hi there.\n\nI'm

been a while, I know.\n\nSo I'm going to be back continuing this project with our LMS using the storybook.js, Superbase, and Radix UI.\n\nSo just to recap of where we got to, we have a component here.\n\nOkay, so we got our header component.\n\nBasically, that's all we've got set up at the moment in our project.\n\nWe're trying to build our components in isolation using the storybook.\n\nAnd in storybook, we will flesh out all our components that we can use, but in that sort of the layout, the stuff that's going to be reused as much as possible.\n\nSo that includes things like the buttons, the header, photo, et cetera, that kind of stuff.\n\nNothing that's real, I guess, layout specific.\n\nOkay, so what have we done so far with the LMS?\n\nNot a lot.\n\nWe've got a homepage.","metadata":{"source":"/Users/andrewford/Developer/Blog/andrewford-co-nz-11ty/content/articles/build-a-full-stack-next-js-radix-components/index.md","loc":{"lines":{"from":25,"to":57}}}}],["04b87c4c-6181-4152-aff8-da8cc759648b",{"pageContent":"Nothing

data.\n\nWe've got Superbase connected up to it.\n\nWe've got a couple of tables.\n\nWe've got courses.\n\nWe've got students and some supplementary tables around those too.\n\nOkay, so if you haven't been keeping up, might pay to have a look at the project.\n\nI'm just going to paste that into the chat.\n\nOkay, so that should come up shortly.\n\nAnd if not, it should be part of the description as well.\n\nWhat I'm going to do next is try and get some of these Radix components, wrap them in our own layers so that we can manipulate them how we would like to use them, and try and get those set up and ready.\n\nSo let's jump into Chrome and I can show you that.\n\nOkay, so that's the project there.\n\nWe've got the LMS, just the actual dev environment there, localhost 3000.\n\nSo not much to see there.","metadata":{"source":"/Users/andrewford/Developer/Blog/andrewford-co-nz-11ty/content/articles/build-a-full-stack-next-js-radix-components/index.md","loc":{"lines":{"from":51,"to":85}}}}],["4f3858a2-275e-4e55-8192-ff3ae8e0b2a5",{"pageContent":"So

okay.\n\nLet's get started.\n\nWe'll start off with this button.\n\nEasy way to get started is I'm literally going to copy this example code and I'm going to place that into our project.\n\nLet's switch to code.\n\nOkay, so I'm going to create a new component and this is going to be button.\n\nI'm going to keep it generic like so.\n\nAnd we need to actually import that from the Redex

just going to prefix all my components so it's obvious which ones are pre-built and which ones are my own.\n\nAnd I'm going to move this up until I return there.\n\nOkay.\n\nReturn like that.\n\nWhat help if I may have used the right brackets there?\n\nOkay, so I'm going to drop out this component here.\n\nNow we'll make that an input.\n\nSo this could be the icon.\n\nSo we're going to need a

the moment, it's not actually getting these Radix themes coming back through.\n\nWe look at what is in the actual documentation here.\n\nWe can see we've actually got quite a few more properties and

why is it not getting our theming?\n\nWhat's wrong?\n\nOkay, so we look at the app itself.\n\nWe've got a page layout.\n\nOkay, so we're not even getting that.\n\nSo we we lay out here now it could be because we're missing this theme part of Radix UI themes in our components here.\n\nSo let's actually test that we can test that by grabbing the Radix UI themes here.\n\nI'm just going to grab this initially and see if it's just a CSS.\n\nIt's not that we'll also add the theme as well.\n\nOkay, switch back to Chrome.\n\nSorry.\n\nIt's not just that we're going to have to also have the theme in

to look at how we can do that to our store a box so that we can actually get those values in there.\n\nLet's undo that.\n\nIt's a little bit trickier.\n\nWe can test our theme styling potentially by

all live.\n\nHello everyone.\n\nSo again, this is the second part in the Builder Fill Stack Next.\n\njs app.\n\nLast week on Thursday, we did a planning session.\n\nAnd so I went through how I was going to plan the app, go through things like a wire framing.\n\nSo we have a link for that here.\n\nAnd we've also got the mind map, which was here.\n\nOkay, so we've got the brainstorm here.","metadata":{"source":"/Users/andrewford/Developer/Blog/andrewford-co-nz-11ty/content/articles/build-a-full-stack-next-js-set-up/index.md","loc":{"lines":{"from":20,"to":50}}}}],["f9f3af78-66a3-4cc7-b678-5fb802bcc5a6",{"pageContent":"So

the list at the moment.\n\nIt's built with fullstack and NextJS, part one planning.\n\nSo if you look at that, there is the link to the video, link to the wireframes, screenshot of the whiteboarding and there's a whole transcript there of the entire video.\n\nSo if you want to quickly find something you can do so.\n\nAwesome!\n\nOkay, all right what are we going to do today?\n\nToday we are going to start setting up the initial parts of the

going to try and start the part of actually building the app, start looking at the wireframe there and start getting that working.\n\nOkay cool okay so if we go to the docs for Next.js\n\nso on the Next.js org website forward slash docs there is a usually what's for pretty much every single website you can imagine these are getting started page and getting started page is generally what we want to look at in in terms of actually installing all the prerequisites there and actually get it up and running.\n\nSo first of all, number one, you're going to need Node.js 16.\n\n14 or later and pretty wide range here.","metadata":{"source":"/Users/andrewford/Developer/Blog/andrewford-co-nz-11ty/content/articles/build-a-full-stack-next-js-set-up/index.md","loc":{"lines":{"from":64,"to":82}}}}],["2c69d16f-2a70-4e4c-a00e-4b9f5c666301",{"pageContent":"So

see.\n\nOK.\n\nSo in my developer directory I'm going to go into YouTube.\n\nCool.\n\nOK, so I'm going to create a new project here.\n\nAgain, we need to look at that MPX command.\n\nSo let's grab that.\n\nCome back to terminal here and this is going to install the latest version of create next.\n\nSo what is your project named?\n\nWe're going to call it LMS next.js.\n\nOK, we're not going to use TypeScript.\n\nI'll do that another time.\n\nWe are going to use lint, use lint, node of tailwind, estimate source directory, yesterday app router, node to the import alias.\n\nSo this is going to set up the over code needed there for React, React-DOM, Next, DSLint, and Excellent Config Next.\n\nFunnily enough it says those things in the Installing Dependencies part there.\n\nSo, okay, cool.","metadata":{"source":"/Users/andrewford/Developer/Blog/andrewford-co-nz-11ty/content/articles/build-a-full-stack-next-js-set-up/index.md","loc":{"lines":{"from":80,"to":118}}}}],["27c09f5b-833e-4713-9840-e42244b5d36b",{"pageContent":"Funnily

it's already set up a Git repo folder there.\n\nI'm going to open up this folder now.\n\nSo open full stop or period depending on where you live.\n\nSo open there is going to open up the finder.\n\nCool so we can see the actual files themselves.\n\nCool and we can do code.\n\nfullstop and that is going to open up a nice vision of VS Code already pointing at that directory.\n\nCool.\n\nOkay so I've got that up and running.\n\nYou should be able to see that on the screen.\n\nWhat I'm going to do next is start talking about what other dependencies we needed.\n\nSo going back to the whiteboard here.\n\nSo I talked about the need to have Radix UI.\n\nSo I was going to use that for my UI components.\n\nway I'm not building them from scratch sort of

accessibility.\n\nInstead I can just focus on I guess the back end parts of the app and not have to worry too much about the front end.\n\nThe other part that I'm going to need is of course Superbase and so we'll set that up as well.\n\nOkay so let's go to the Radix UI website.\n\nOkay again it's a nice big getting started button let's use that.\n\nAgain, I'm going to copy that and I am going to open up the terminal window here.\n\nOkay.\n\nSo while that's installing, let's go back and have a look at the getting started guide here.\n\nAfter that, I need to import the global CSS file at the

here, we actually have the actual layer of the app.\n\nOkay, let's have a quick look at this, get our head around what's actually happening.\n\nSo first up we have a page.\n\nIt's a home component and we also have an image being pulled into it.\n\nSo this is the actual content of that page and the layout would be the core part of the app is being built.\n\nYou can see there that we have the HTML

move it like so.\n\nOkay, cool.\n\nBody theme.\n\nOkay, I might actually do the same as what they have done.\n\nProbably pays to pay attention to what the instructions are doing.\n\nOkay and I've got an extra tag there.\n\nCool.\n\nAll right.\n\nOkay so we have the theme going now.\n\nIf we actually run the application, let's see what happens.\n\nThat's localhost 3000.\n\nOkay, so we're not seeing any sort of UI changes or anything like that.\n\nWe've probably still got the initial stylings there from Next.js.\n\nLet's go with the

out to this global style sheet and probably not going to use that.\n\nAgain it's starting to look very sparse and And if I do the same here, I'm going to have to be mindful of the fact that there's

themes.\n\nOkay, we are on the way to getting there.\n\nOkay, all right.\n\nNext steps, you're now ready to use Radix themes components.\n\nCool.\n\nI will probably stop there and a good place to stop probably is now into a commit of my source code.\n\nand it should commit added vertex UI.\n\nSo if you've got the GitHub extension here, you can actually also do the same as this and publish it

of our app.\n\nOkay so let's find the Superbase website.\n\nCool, so I've already previously signed on with GitHub before, and I need to now create a new project.\n\nOK, I'll call it LMS.\n\nand copy

it.\n\nAs you can see it's just literally a HTML header component with the H1 inside it there.\n\nWe didn't place it anywhere inside our app but we can keep going on that.\n\nLet's take a look at what we've actually done so far.\n\nSo we have gone through some planning last week.\n\nSo let's switch to Chrome, we'll just take a look at that.\n\nSo in Chrome we set up the planning for the Kanban

of things to help us in terms of building our React components.\n\nOne thing I like to do when working on a new project is to actually have a thing called Storybook.\n\nNow Storybook is a way for us to have a playground where we can build our components in isolation.\n\nWe can style them to our sort of heart's content away from the main app and it means that we can sort of configure them, set up easily the different properties for them, even have some dummy data set up so that we can maybe enable, disable, add new titles, content, you name it, that kind of thing.\n\nWe can do that.","metadata":{"source":"/Users/andrewford/Developer/Blog/andrewford-co-nz-11ty/content/articles/build-a-full-stack-next-js-storybook/index.md","loc":{"lines":{"from":51,"to":69}}}}],["77c4ac96-94c8-4ab6-a9a9-30e340f38749",{"pageContent":"We

that.","metadata":{"source":"/Users/andrewford/Developer/Blog/andrewford-co-nz-11ty/content/articles/build-a-full-stack-next-js-storybook/index.md","loc":{"lines":{"from":201,"to":241}}}}],["95f27c2d-1f76-473e-b8b5-eb623a87c702",{"pageContent":"Okay,

that.\n\nStorybook is built from stories.\n\nStorybook stories represent the key states of each of your components.\n\nWe automatically added four stories for this button component in this example file button dot stories dot JS.\n\nTo note that it's got these separate files here called stories.\n\nSo we can have our variations there.\n\nStory previews are interactive.\n\nSo when you modify code or story, storybook automatically updates how it previews your components.\n\nAnd this is the key core beauty of storybook here.\n\nYou are going to be able to see your components in isolation without any impact from the actual UI itself.\n\nMaybe other things could impact what your look and feel looks like.","metadata":{"source":"/Users/andrewford/Developer/Blog/andrewford-co-nz-11ty/content/articles/build-a-full-stack-next-js-storybook/index.md","loc":{"lines":{"from":229,"to":261}}}}],["6ce3c683-9364-41c8-a7de-46419dd2595f",{"pageContent":"You are going to be able to see your components in isolation without any impact from the actual UI itself.\n\nMaybe other things could impact what your look and feel looks like.\n\nSo the way that you make your components with storybook is that you then hopefully make them all just independent of each other.\n\nAnd that's the whole goal of building components because we want to be able to reuse them.\n\nSo storybook previews are interactive.\n\nAnd you'll see here it's got this cool playground here where we have the controls and we can set values.\n\nWe can change this value here to false.\n\nHey, confetti.\n\nNice.\n\nSo with that, we can change that state from being primary to not being primary.\n\nSo it's just got a false there.\n\nSo that means that we can very quickly have just by properties alone, we can change a button to be of the primary type.\n\nSo what would that be?\n\nThat it could be maybe like on A form.\n\nMaybe you've got a save and a cancel.","metadata":{"source":"/Users/andrewford/Developer/Blog/andrewford-co-nz-11ty/content/articles/build-a-full-stack-next-js-storybook/index.md","loc":{"lines":{"from":259,"to":287}}}}],["905fd487-f66e-4522-a0b0-37fd250393e2",{"pageContent":"So

ask the user to do.\n\nAnd then the cancel would be the non-primary look.\n\nSo less sort of eye-catching there.\n\nOkay.\n\nSo now it's got this little wizard here on how to write a story.\n\nSo these imports, first import meter and story object for type safety and autocompletion and typescript stories.\n\nWe're not using the likes of typescripts.\n\nSo we want to use it in this case.\n\nNext import a component, in this case, the button component.\n\nAnd then the default export, it contains metadata about this component stories.\n\nThe title field optional controls where stories appear in the sidebar.\n\nOkay.\n\nSo you got that button, you got a title.\n\nSo this is what you can name it for your example here.\n\nSo each named export is a story.","metadata":{"source":"/Users/andrewford/Developer/Blog/andrewford-co-nz-11ty/content/articles/build-a-full-stack-next-js-storybook/index.md","loc":{"lines":{"from":283,"to":317}}}}],["e6da9974-fc23-4064-9fb3-bdd92d61bb34",{"pageContent":"Okay.\n\nSo

small.\n\nI can see there on the left.\n\nSo we follow through this.\n\nWe can see all these arguments here.\n\nSo in this story file, we can set up each of these stories and each have its own object.\n\nAnd each object has its own arguments.\n\nOkay.\n\nSo these are all stuff that you set.\n\nThese are the properties for the components themselves.\n\nSo I would imagine this button component has got the properties of primary, label and background.\n\nOkay.\n\nSo those are properties for that component.\n\nSo if you cast your mind back to where your views react, maybe in the

not kind of happy about is we've got our nice sort of component structure.\n\nAnd this comes down to personal preference.\n\nThis is not set in stone or anything.\n\nThe one downside, I guess,

now, our homepage.\n\nSimply got the logo and menu.\n\nVery basic.\n\nOkay.\n\nSo we'll step back to this.\n\nWhat was our design?\n\nLet's get back to code.\n\nOkay.\n\nAll right.\n\nSo I've got the

Andrew discusses how to display a list of courses on a webpage using data from a Supabase database. He explains how to use SQL queries to retrieve data from the database and display it on the webpage and also mentions using Superbase's table editor to edit the database and provides a brief overview of plans for future development.\nogimage: \"full-stack3.jpg\"\n---\n\n{% figure \"./full-stack3.jpg\", \"&quot;A web full-stack app built with NextJS&quot; / Bing Image Creator\" %}","metadata":{"source":"/Users/andrewford/Developer/Blog/andrewford-co-nz-11ty/content/articles/build-a-full-stack-next-js-supabase/index.md","loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":20}}}}],["0e9122b2-1995-48ea-b0d6-e3694b80a0ed",{"pageContent":"{% figure \"./full-stack3.jpg\", \"&quot;A web full-stack app built with NextJS&quot; / Bing Image Creator\" %}\n\nThe following is a transcript of my live stream on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/live/LCnHOpg7U7s) Sep 28, 2023 on Building a Full-Stack web app with Next.js. This is the third video in the series where I use [Supabase](https://supabase.com) as the database for the app. In the video I create a table to hold our courses. I then load it with some data of some course names and then finally display the results of the data in a list.\n\nThe project is available on [GitHub as LMS NextJS](https://github.com/andrewjamesford/lms-nextjs).\n\nyoutube.com/embed/LCnHOpg7U7s?si=4nK2Xr8rFvh9TuWr\n\n---\n\nAlright, hey there.\n\nOkay, so this stream is going to be on using Superbase.\n\nWe're going to continue on with the rest of the stream, I guess, with trying to build an XJS app from scratch.\n\nAnd we've gone through the planning stages already.","metadata":{"source":"/Users/andrewford/Developer/Blog/andrewford-co-nz-11ty/content/articles/build-a-full-stack-next-js-supabase/index.md","loc":{"lines":{"from":20,"to":36}}}}],["ce49b309-d95a-4059-b781-b0221006aaa7",{"pageContent":"We're

we're now at the point where we are going to set up the database.\n\nSo how are we going to do this?\n\nWell first things, let's jump to the Superbase website because it's got a really good walkthrough there of a quick start.\n\nOkay, so you can see here it's got the likes of Superbase with XJS.\n\nThat's what we're using It's asking for creating a new project on the Superbase dashboard Okay, and goes through the process of setting up a table in the database Okay, so if we go to the Superbase dashboard Okay, so I've got this this is my project the LMS one And I've got no tables in it at present.\n\nSo I'm gonna create a new table just like the guide showed us and I'm gonna insert some data into it as well Of course on this one, I'm not gonna be adding countries.","metadata":{"source":"/Users/andrewford/Developer/Blog/andrewford-co-nz-11ty/content/articles/build-a-full-stack-next-js-supabase/index.md","loc":{"lines":{"from":34,"to":48}}}}],["1c3326ef-9a69-47b8-a01a-db1e941fee7f",{"pageContent":"So

courses for the LMS So let's go and do so So create a new table.\n\nNo, you want to pluralize the name of course, so courses.\n\nI'll disable RLS for now.\n\nYou probably wouldn't want to do this.\n\nActually, no, I'll keep it on.\n\nLet's keep it on.\n\nI'll do something else instead.\n\nthinking through.\n\nSo we're gonna have the likes of a new public table, we're gonna have an ID and it's created at.\n\nThis is a nice little simple user interface.\n\nYou can do the same using some SQL but the interface is pretty good in terms of that.\n\nSo let's do that.\n\nOkay so we're gonna need a few things I guess for a course name, a course name, so I'm going to have a name here and it's going to be some text.\n\nOr Basha, Basha probably would be better.\n\nAnd I'm going to add a description.","metadata":{"source":"/Users/andrewford/Developer/Blog/andrewford-co-nz-11ty/content/articles/build-a-full-stack-next-js-supabase/index.md","loc":{"lines":{"from":48,"to":78}}}}],["2755fd70-2106-450b-b6a5-f9d38b0f1bd9",{"pageContent":"Or

an image, I think.\n\nLet's do that.\n\nNow, I think it could have us as some data, but probably the easiest thing to do in this scenario.\n\nOf course, we don't want to to load out a database or anything like that.\n\nSuperbase doesn't really give you the option there to add the data directly to it, but we can instead add a virtual character string length there and then we can have the image URL.\n\nWe would use some sort of some storage system to save that into a database.\n\nOkay, so we got an image, we got a name, we got a description, we got the created at let's save that.\n\nOkay, so we should shortly see it loading up the table.\n\nHere we go.\n\nOkay, so we've got no data in here at the moment.\n\nWe've got a name, a description, an image, an ID, and this table here.","metadata":{"source":"/Users/andrewford/Developer/Blog/andrewford-co-nz-11ty/content/articles/build-a-full-stack-next-js-supabase/index.md","loc":{"lines":{"from":76,"to":104}}}}],["80704414-1fb6-4935-8436-e6b09f67d2f8",{"pageContent":"Okay,

going back to the guide, we can actually start adding some values to our table.\n\nSo there's a SQL Editor to do that.\n\nLet's start off with that.\n\nOkay, so on the left hand side here, you've got sort of the table editor and then you've got the SQL editor If we open that up And this is the new AI stuff We'll do just a new query Okay Is that That's just confusing I'm having some trouble with the entering there.\n\nI don't know where that is.\n\nAnyway, let's insert some data.\n\nSo this was the last time I've done this before.\n\nSo we're going to insert into the courses table.\n\nand set into name, that's what we're going to add.\n\nAnd grab that, and just change it.\n\nOkay, so we've got a name there and the value is going to be ReactForBeginner.\n\nOkay.\n\nOkay.\n\nThis is setting

change.","metadata":{"source":"/Users/andrewford/Developer/Blog/andrewford-co-nz-11ty/content/articles/build-a-full-stack-next-js-supabase/index.md","loc":{"lines":{"from":98,"to":132}}}}],["fefea8cb-0df5-45cb-a352-d693640e0f37",{"pageContent":"and

it as a insert there, I could have probably say add name value called to the table there.\n\nLet's try that.\n\nSet that change.\n\nIs that going to let me?\n\nHm, it's not getting so.\n\nI don't know why that's not letting me.\n\nWeird.\n\nThis is not making this easy.\n\nOh, okay.\n\nSo it's like it's not letting me actually edit this.\n\nThis is great.\n\nHmm.\n\nMaybe I found a bug?\n\nMaybe I have.\n\nNot to worry.\n\nLet's see what it says.\n\nSo include an almost stardomirter and aqueurries.\n\nLet's see if it will let us execute it then.\n\nNo!\n\nI wonder why this is breaking.\n\nIt's

that.\n\nOkay now I can do this.\n\nLet's hopefully I can run this and it should add this to my database.\n\nCool.\n\nSuccess, that's good.\n\nLet's go back to our table view.\n\nClose that one.\n\nAnd we'll open that.\n\nOkay, so straight away we've got some new data now in our table.\n\nWe've got the record there for reHJS.\n\nWe've got no description or image yet, but we can start adding some more records in here.\n\nJust to get something this way on the page once we list out these from the database.\n\nI'm going to go back to the edit there.\n\nI'm going to add another one we have.","metadata":{"source":"/Users/andrewford/Developer/Blog/andrewford-co-nz-11ty/content/articles/build-a-full-stack-next-js-supabase/index.md","loc":{"lines":{"from":170,"to":218}}}}],["d2f82d99-e4c5-47f0-85a7-7f3c4bc532bd",{"pageContent":"Just

that record on as well and we'll do it one more What's number one HTML 5 HTML was new.\n\nOkay, cool, so that's added.\n\nAnd if we go back to our table view, sure enough, we've got those three records now.\n\nWe've got a name there for each of them.\n\nIt's almost a dimension description, but we can add that in later.\n\nOkay, let's go back to the guide here.\n\nOkay.\n\nAnd we can see here that we've got.\n\nI haven't seen that before on the hopper now.\n\nIt shows you how much memory each tab is using.\n\nPretty cool.\n\nI haven't seen that before.\n\nThat's all good.\n\nOkay, so we've

yellow mess here.\n\nOkay, so in here I have a local env example.\n\nSo what you're going to need to do is go into your settings for Superbase here, just like the link here, follow this link here, it'll take you to the API page, you'll have a URL you'll have an anonymous key.\n\nYou'll need to put those into an .\n\nenv file and something like that.\n\nnv.\n\nlocal, that's a good place to start.\n\nAdd those keys in there and that's what I've already done.\n\nSo if we look at my code.\n\nOkay, so just like I said, I've got an example file here, you'd add those keys in there.","metadata":{"source":"/Users/andrewford/Developer/Blog/andrewford-co-nz-11ty/content/articles/build-a-full-stack-next-js-supabase/index.md","loc":{"lines":{"from":248,"to":280}}}}],["f8f3958f-bf26-4923-a5a0-8b9ef9281207",{"pageContent":"Add

and start so that you get your environment keys to load because without it your app won't reload the environment variables unless you do that.\n\nOkay so once you've done that you've added those keys in there.\n\nWe can go back to the tutorial.\n\nOkay and it's got an example here.\n\nThey've got a page that they've created, so countries page.\n\nOkay so that's for a type script file and what they've done is they've created a component, used the cookies there to import the header there and then it does a call off to the Superbase library and gets the countries for that.\n\nSo for those that maybe have done some SQL in the past it pretty much is very much a similar sort of look to SQL for Superbase.","metadata":{"source":"/Users/andrewford/Developer/Blog/andrewford-co-nz-11ty/content/articles/build-a-full-stack-next-js-supabase/index.md","loc":{"lines":{"from":276,"to":294}}}}],["ea610a87-6514-4576-a0c2-de3e994a46b6",{"pageContent":"So

tables, again using a from there, there's your word in the select statement, and you've got a this select statement at the end there, hand by default I believe, having no value in the actual brackets there means that you're going to get all the columns on the table.\n\nSo let's start something like this up, let's actually go and add something like this to our page.\n\nNow we can add a new page so it might be a good idea to have a courses page.\n\nSo I'm going to jump into this code.\n\nOkay so we've got our structure here on the right hand side.\n\nOkay so we've got an app And there is a page.\n\nSo what I can have is the same again.\n\nIf you haven't looked at the document page and system of Next.","metadata":{"source":"/Users/andrewford/Developer/Blog/andrewford-co-nz-11ty/content/articles/build-a-full-stack-next-js-supabase/index.md","loc":{"lines":{"from":294,"to":310}}}}],["0d003be6-ec64-43d2-b864-cea5b798b175",{"pageContent":"Okay

app router, layout being the actual what's going to be displayed in terms of layout, and page is the actual sort of content for it.\n\nSo if we look at layout there, we've got a layout we're loading in some styles etc.\n\nwhich is all cool.\n\nNow let's go and go and add a new folder.\n\nOkay, so the App Router works basically by having a new folder name and in it you can have a page file.\n\nSo I'm going to have a folder called countries.\n\nLike that.\n\nOkay, so we've got the countries and we're going to need a page file.\n\nAll right.\n\nAnd we're going to need to have a component on there.\n\nSo what would that look like?\n\nThat could be something along the lines of this maybe.\n\nSo we're just typing that out.","metadata":{"source":"/Users/andrewford/Developer/Blog/andrewford-co-nz-11ty/content/articles/build-a-full-stack-next-js-supabase/index.md","loc":{"lines":{"from":306,"to":336}}}}],["446258d0-1148-41a6-86c1-b9a571e9fd23",{"pageContent":"All

going to export a export default and we're going to need to have this be async because we're going to be pulling in data for this home component.\n\nMaybe I should just call it, call it horses.\n\nOkay and in that we will need to have, we're going to actually import the Superbase library.\n\nSo if you haven't, we probably should actually check to see if we've got this installed.\n\nAlways we won't be able to.\n\nYes I have installed it in the past.\n\nOkay So what you could do in terms of that is go to the command line, run npm install and superbase js and superbase auth help as an xjs as dependencies that look something like this.\n\nAnd we can take those same two libraries.\n\nSo the great thing about npm on the install command there is you can actually have multiple items in there.","metadata":{"source":"/Users/andrewford/Developer/Blog/andrewford-co-nz-11ty/content/articles/build-a-full-stack-next-js-supabase/index.md","loc":{"lines":{"from":328,"to":354}}}}],["2c2b95eb-8c2b-46bb-92a8-63789da87132",{"pageContent":"And

here.\n\nSo I need to import the server component client and the cookies header that was on that same tutorial on the Superbase website.\n\nLet's do that.\n\nOkay, directly copy from the tutorial there.\n\nI'll paste that into the notes as well so that we can see that if you guys are following along in the chat.\n\nOkay, awesome.\n\nAlright, so now we've got that set up.\n\nThe next thing we're gonna do is actually go and start setting this up.\n\nOkay, so we've got a courses component.\n\nWe need to render something, of course, from it.\n\nBut so we need to get the the server-based

trying to do, but no, we don't want to quite do that.\n\nThat's slightly different to what we want.\n\nAnd yeah, create the server-compliant client.\n\nI think it's got to be like this.\n\nOkay, so the cookie's there.\n\nand we then need to have a way to retrieve data.\n\nLook at that, it's actually even, it's copied the same bit of text there that is sitting on the, probably enough, the tutorial.\n\nWe're not going to grab from the countries, we're going to grab from the courses And like I mentioned before, it's very much like an SQL statement.\n\nSo you've got the from there, so the

of expected that.\n\nAnd there's a reason for that.\n\nAnd it's basically to do with the security here for the app.\n\nSo what we need to do to make that accessible, we can do a couple of things, but probably the easiest one to do so is go into our table and what we can do for it is set the policies on it.\n\nOkay, let's view policies.\n\nAnd what we want to actually do is we want to make a new

nice little policies here.","metadata":{"source":"/Users/andrewford/Developer/Blog/andrewford-co-nz-11ty/content/articles/build-a-full-stack-next-js-supabase/index.md","loc":{"lines":{"from":426,"to":458}}}}],["f2479b39-1210-4e7a-bac7-ae0a23ddca45",{"pageContent":"And

really granular control here with Superbase in it.\n\nyou can actually set what operations you can do and can't do.\n\nAnd in this case, it's pretty much all ready to go.\n\nSo I only want to be able to use a select there, and I want to just have that showing basically.\n\nThat's pretty much all I need.\n\nA good thing to do is read this when you get a chance, is the documentation.\n\nBut let's

from the likes of Superbase, it's made it very simple to do the likes of our select requests and unlike As you can imagine having a kind of syntax like this is also going to help stop being able to do sort of SQL injection and the likes So having the client Tool like this is pretty handy So what we've got we've got a list at the moment and unordered list and each list item we display the course

ChatGPT?\n\nChatGPT is an open-source chatbot that uses GPT-3 (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) to generate natural language responses based on the user's input. In the tech community, there is a lot of excitement for where Machine Learning tools like it can be used next.\n\n## What could I use ChatGPT for?\n\n[ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/chat) can be used for a variety of purposes, including creating conversational chatbots and virtual assistants, automated customer service bots, natural language processing tasks such as sentiment analysis or text summarization, and more.","metadata":{"source":"/Users/andrewford/Developer/Blog/andrewford-co-nz-11ty/content/articles/chatgpt-macos-ios-using-shortcuts/index.md","loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":23}}}}],["f7234bd0-b6fb-41ff-8f3a-6effa67fc3ce",{"pageContent":"You could use it to rewrite a paragraph that your not happy with in a document, move past your writers block or use it like a personal assistant to write an email reply.

I wanted to be able to use it from any application on both macOS or iOS, so I put together a way to use the ChatGPT API via an [Apple Shortcut](https://support.apple.com/en-nz/guide/shortcuts/welcome/ios).\n\n## What are Apple Shortcuts?","metadata":{"source":"/Users/andrewford/Developer/Blog/andrewford-co-nz-11ty/content/articles/chatgpt-macos-ios-using-shortcuts/index.md","loc":{"lines":{"from":25,"to":29}}}}],["9c6f3e2f-8c0c-4bf5-998a-ee9692e93e0e",{"pageContent":"## What are Apple Shortcuts?\n\nApple Shortcuts is a powerful automation app for iPhone, iPad and Mac that allows users to create automated workflows. It can be used to automate tasks such as sending messages, navigating maps, controlling music playback, opening apps and more. With Apple Shortcuts, users can save time by automating repetitive tasks so they can focus on the things that matter most.\n\n## Creating a \"shortcut\" using the ChatGPT API\n\n**🚨 Update 🚨**\n\n**Since I wrote this Open AI have released an iOS app with a shortcut action [see how it works here](https://andrewford.co.nz/articles/chatgpt-shortcut-on-ios).**\n\n{% image \"./openai-create-new-key.png\", \"How to create an OpenAI key\" %}\n\nTo be able to use the Shortcut I've created you will need to first create an account with [OpenAI](https://beta.openai.com/signup). Head to their sign up page, fill in your details then got to the [View API Keys page](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys). Follow the instructions above.","metadata":{"source":"/Users/andrewford/Developer/Blog/andrewford-co-nz-11ty/content/articles/chatgpt-macos-ios-using-shortcuts/index.md","loc":{"lines":{"from":29,"to":41}}}}],["b3fd41bf-16c8-45b8-9f98-3281957a94ab",{"pageContent":"{% image \"./openai-api-key-generated.png\", \"Generate OpenAI key\" %}\n\nYou then need to create an API key to use with our Shortcut, click on the \"+ Create new secret key\" button. Copy the new key by clicking the green button.\n\nEither on macOS or on iOS [click this link to my shortcut](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/376d66df029f4a74b2e2098fd0253cd1) and \"Add Shortcut\".\n\nOpen up the shortcut (right click and Edit on macOS) to edit. Paste the key into the Text section of the shortcut shown in the image below and close the shortcut.\n\n{% image \"./add-key-shortcut.png\", \"Add key to shortcut\" %}\n\nFor personal use they credited $18 until May for me when I created an account. I've barely run up any credit so far. Under $0.10, in fact it's very cheap.\n\n## How to use it?\n\nThis shortcut is flexible in that it can be used in multiple ways. If no text is selected it will take the contents of the clipboard. Otherwise you can select text in iOS and then use the Share icon like in the video below.","metadata":{"source":"/Users/andrewford/Developer/Blog/andrewford-co-nz-11ty/content/articles/chatgpt-macos-ios-using-shortcuts/index.md","loc":{"lines":{"from":43,"to":57}}}}],["a365f792-ad21-4de8-ac92-b8cdde36dab0",{"pageContent":"youtube.com/embed/LdzR17IGpQw\n\nOn macOS it's a little different. You first select the text and copy it to your clipboard. You can then invoke the shortcut by going up to the menu bar and running the shortcut from there.\n\n{% image \"./shortcuts-macOS.png\", \"Run a shortcut on macOS from the menu bar\" %}\n\n## Alternative way to use the shortcut (macOS)\n\n{% image \"./popclip-in-action.png\", \"PopClip in action\" %}\n\nI'm a big fan of the app [PopClip](https://pilotmoon.com/popclip/) on macOS that acts like the pop up selection menu for copy and paste on iOS (as seen in the image above). It can be used to invoke a Shortcut and I've created an [extension](https://andrewford.co.nz/assets/ChatGPTpopclipext.zip) that allows me to select some text with the mouse and then trigger the ChatGPT shortcut.

I'd suggest you use the FREE [AI Actions](https://apps.apple.com/nz/app/ai-actions-for-shortcuts/id6465250302) app from Sindre Sorhus which will allow you to build your own custom AI actions in Shortcuts or the official [ChatGPT app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/chatgpt/id6448311069).","metadata":{"source":"/Users/andrewford/Developer/Blog/andrewford-co-nz-11ty/content/articles/chatgpt-shortcut-on-ios/index.md","loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":18}}}}],["ee58c703-bbbf-45d7-863a-ae437496f17e",{"pageContent":"Previously I wrote about [how to use ChatGPT on macOS and iOS using Shortcuts](/articles/chatgpt-macos-ios-using-shortcuts).

This means you don't need to create an OpenAI API key to use it, history is available in the app and less _copy & pasting_ on an iPhone (which is not always easy).\n\nyoutube.com/embed/fD1nNVAyY7E\n\n### How to use it","metadata":{"source":"/Users/andrewford/Developer/Blog/andrewford-co-nz-11ty/content/articles/chatgpt-shortcut-on-ios/index.md","loc":{"lines":{"from":20,"to":24}}}}],["d17f8ccc-81ce-4274-bf83-61c4e7305b56",{"pageContent":"youtube.com/embed/fD1nNVAyY7E\n\n### How to use it\n\n1. Install the [ChatGPT app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/chatgpt/id6448311069) from the App Store\n2. Install my [ChatGPT shortcut from here](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/34ad5973ed41401bab872a407e324da1) and click the \"Get Shortcut\" button\n3. Make sure you have signed in to the ChatGPT app (if not open it now and login)\n4. From the share sheet on an article on Safari scroll the page down to you come across the share action \"ChatGPT\" and tap it\n5. The shortcut will open a prompt asking \"What would you like ChatGPT to do?\"\n6. Enter a prompt of your own choosing, I like to use \"Summarize this article\" or \"Summarize this page\"\n7. The shortcut will show a loading icon and then display your answer in an alert box with a \"Done\" button\n8. The shortcut automatically copies the answer to your clipboard so you can paste it into another app\n\n{% figure \"./chatgpt-ios-shortcut.webp\", \"Using the shortcut to summarise an article\" %}","metadata":{"source":"/Users/andrewford/Developer/Blog/andrewford-co-nz-11ty/content/articles/chatgpt-shortcut-on-ios/index.md","loc":{"lines":{"from":22,"to":35}}}}],["a6c0fdba-cbff-4fbc-83e0-7f1f2dd75b8e",{"pageContent":"{% figure \"./chatgpt-ios-shortcut.webp\", \"Using the shortcut to summarise an article\" %}\n\n### How it works\n\nThe shortcut takes input from the Share Sheet \"Text\", \"Rich Text\", \"Safari web pages\" and \"Articles\". It then gets your prompt from the input box that pops up. It then appends say the URL of a website to your prompt. For example I was on an article on [Stuff](https://i.stuff.co.nz/national/education/300847887/chatgpt-how-teachers-are-bringing-ai-tech-into-the-classroom) and this is what is passed to ChatGPT:\n\n```text\n\"Summarise this article\" +\nhttps://i.stuff.co.nz/...\n```\n\nThe shortcut then passes that to the action provided by the ChatGPT iOS app which returns the answer. The shortcut then displays the answer in an alert box and copies it to the clipboard.\n\n### Why should I use this shortcut?","metadata":{"source":"/Users/andrewford/Developer/Blog/andrewford-co-nz-11ty/content/articles/chatgpt-shortcut-on-ios/index.md","loc":{"lines":{"from":35,"to":48}}}}],["5f875a63-83a7-491a-a074-7e0b66d0edd9",{"pageContent":"### Why should I use this shortcut?\n\nThe shortcut is a native iOS shortcut that uses the ChatGPT app action to perform an action directly from the context that you currently in. Say you have seen an article and you would like to summarise it.\n\nInstead of having to select and copy text to your clipboard which can be hard to do on a iPhone or iPad you can just tap the share sheet and select the ChatGPT shortcut. The shortcut will then perform what you prompt it to do.\n\nThe best part about this as this is you are using your logged in account in the ChatGPT app and can open the app and see the history of all the prompts you have made. This is a great way to keep track of what you have been doing or to go back to read a previous summary.\n\n### What are the limitations?","metadata":{"source":"/Users/andrewford/Developer/Blog/andrewford-co-nz-11ty/content/articles/chatgpt-shortcut-on-ios/index.md","loc":{"lines":{"from":48,"to":56}}}}],["0d868cbf-74f7-4b4b-b2ac-34232dac0da0",{"pageContent":"### What are the limitations?\n\nThe only limitation is because the ChatGPT app is not on MacOS you can't use this same shortcut on your Mac.

In a in-person classroom this could be done by simply having class members swap seats to switch who is using the keyboard and mouse of who is coding.","metadata":{"source":"/Users/andrewford/Developer/Blog/andrewford-co-nz-11ty/content/articles/collaboration-when-learning-software-development/index.md","loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":17}}}}],["aaff3c56-bcc1-40c0-92e8-d3182e97ce6e",{"pageContent":"This used to be a lot more difficult when teaching remotely, you could always share a screen via [Zoom](https://zoom.us) or [Google Meet](https://meet.google.com) but it wasn't easy for another learner to work on the exact same code base without syncing files in some way. That has changed a lot in the last couple of years with some great new tools that allow much easier collaboration working on the same code base.\n\n## Live Share for Visual Studio Code\n\nA perfect choice for those that already use the extremely popular [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) from Microsoft is the [Live Share](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MS-vsliveshare.vsliveshare) extension. It allows you to share the code on your local PC with a link it copies to your clipboard. Simply send that link to the learners in a [Zoom](https://zoom.us) or [Google Meet](https://meet.google.com) call. Then the entire class will be able to connect to the same session.","metadata":{"source":"/Users/andrewford/Developer/Blog/andrewford-co-nz-11ty/content/articles/collaboration-when-learning-software-development/index.md","loc":{"lines":{"from":19,"to":23}}}}],["b86f1ec3-cc31-4c40-bc57-8e924f786f7c",{"pageContent":"{% image \"./vscode-live-share.png\", \"Using the VS Code Live \" %}\n\nOne user (the instructor) can act as the Host and share the exact file they are working on and force the other clients to focus on items you wish to highlight. It even shows the cursor position with a little pop up of the person that moved it. It's even possible to share your terminal.\n\nWhile it may get the code sharing running up quickly it's only downside is to run the code locally you would have to setup the environment (installing Node or Python etc which may or may not be an issue).\n\n## Replit\n\nAnother option that allows screen sharing with nothing but a link and a browser is [Replit](https://replit.com/). It's an entire IDE ([Integrated Development Environment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment)) in your browser.\n\n{% image \"./replit-python.png\", \"Replit with Python \" %}","metadata":{"source":"/Users/andrewford/Developer/Blog/andrewford-co-nz-11ty/content/articles/collaboration-when-learning-software-development/index.md","loc":{"lines":{"from":25,"to":35}}}}],["db5a1e8e-d928-43f3-ad9c-55ecadf979f9",{"pageContent":"{% image \"./replit-python.png\", \"Replit with Python \" %}\n\nThe best part is you can have multiple people collaborate, run tests, use the terminal all while previewing the resulting code results in a browser (with a console). It's great for getting started quickly as it has a whole suite of templates for all sorts of projects including NodeJS, Python, Java, Ruby, Go, C#, ReactJS, Vue, and HTML/CSS. No stress about setting up the development environment, just select the appropriate template, run and share the link with your class.\n\nThe other benefit is the code can be forked easily. In the past I've used it for demos while teaching. Learners can take what you started with, fork (make another copy) and make changes to further their own learning in their own time. Of course they can share any changes after.","metadata":{"source":"/Users/andrewford/Developer/Blog/andrewford-co-nz-11ty/content/articles/collaboration-when-learning-software-development/index.md","loc":{"lines":{"from":35,"to":39}}}}],["2ffade8c-dd25-4210-bbff-b2f1485fb14c",{"pageContent":"These are just two tools that can make collaboration in the classroom or the workplace as easy as clicking on a link.

I suggest starting with some basic components like Headings & Buttons followed by common form controls. The storybook documentation on the welcome screen has a link to a great site quickly summarising [component driven development](https://www.componentdriven.org/).\n\nBy default, Storybook creates a folder called `stories` that contains component files, stories files and CSS files all matching the appropriate component name. For example `header.css`, `Header.tsx` and `Header.stories.tsx`.","metadata":{"source":"/Users/andrewford/Developer/Blog/andrewford-co-nz-11ty/content/articles/create-your-own-ui-component-library/index.md","loc":{"lines":{"from":33,"to":51}}}}],["43108a82-06f2-4580-89fd-7d317c73f460",{"pageContent":"My preference is to instead create a `components` and `pages` folder.

zebra striped\nvalue set to true.\n\nSo you can see in the example here I have put a minimum width of 300 pixels and\nwhen we try to close it to that size it stays at that minimum width.\n\nIt's common with responsive design that you want to have different breakpoints\nand show different sizes so you can do this with the esx prop by using the\narray.\n\nSo in the first example here the breakpoint is for the larger size and it's set\nto be the 750 pixel mark.\n\nNow if we make the viewport smaller we can see that the minimum width switches\ndown to the 300.\n\n##

have\nthe ability to customize it in terms of adding a striped value.\n\nNot only that we are using the arrays to set the minimum width of the table\nthere.\n\nFinally we have a drop down and we've

So this can help to improve productivity and reduce the risk of errors. So stopping that tool works on my machine, but doesn't work on yours that kind of thing the improved productivity is is dev containers can help to improve the productivity by providing developers with a ready-to-use environment that does not require any setup or configuration.\n\nWe love that, don't we?\n\nBeing able to just get started without having to battle through a config.\n\nSo that can save a whole little time and frustration.\n\nReduce risk of errors.","metadata":{"source":"/Users/andrewford/Developer/Blog/andrewford-co-nz-11ty/content/articles/dev-containers-in-vs-code/index.md","loc":{"lines":{"from":71,"to":89}}}}],["0d68298d-a604-4425-80eb-5ce2cc4fe126",{"pageContent":"We

containers can help to reduce the risk of errors by isolating the development environment from the production environment.\n\nThis can help to prevent errors from being introduced in the production environment.\n\nHey people, integrated with VS Code, but development experience is much nicer than working with Docker containers alone.\n\nSo one cool thing is with VS Code and the containers is that the terminal can actually be looking at the container itself, which is pretty awesome.\n\nSo it's a UI one there.\n\nAnother real benefit of it is the ability to run in Codespaces.\n\nWhat are Codespaces, you're probably asking?\n\nSo it's basically a thing that GitHub has, where you can run one of these dev containers on a machine in the cloud.\n\nAnd you can do all your development.","metadata":{"source":"/Users/andrewford/Developer/Blog/andrewford-co-nz-11ty/content/articles/dev-containers-in-vs-code/index.md","loc":{"lines":{"from":83,"to":107}}}}],["511e2b0c-0712-4d25-a289-c2ca2949e996",{"pageContent":"What

on.\n\nMaybe you've got some really big requirements.\n\nMaybe you're working on a low spec machine and you need something with a lot of RAM.\n\nWith the dev containers there, you could specify that machine to have a whole lot of RAM, and then you'd be able to use that in the cloud.\n\nNow you can use that in VS Code, or you can even use it in a browser, which is pretty cool.\n\nOkay, the other cool thing with Dev Containers is that it's easy swapping between projects with different dependencies.\n\nSay you had a project that was using Node.js 16 and this new one needed 20.","metadata":{"source":"/Users/andrewford/Developer/Blog/andrewford-co-nz-11ty/content/articles/dev-containers-in-vs-code/index.md","loc":{"lines":{"from":103,"to":125}}}}],["99cc9faa-b82d-4723-bcf6-277fded8c5d5",{"pageContent":"Okay,

running the containers, neither version will be installed on your local file system.\n\nInstead, it's going to be sitting in those containers and it's going to keep your computer craft free, which is really handy.\n\nAs you can imagine, every time that you'd want to have to switch between to node 16 and 20, you'd have to use some other tool to do that.\n\nAnd the same thing could be had between, say, different versions of Python or .NET Core for starters.\n\nAnd being able to easily switch between them just by running up a container means we don't have to worry about what's installed on your

errors.\n\nCool.\n\nA few friendly faces that I can see in the chat there, hi everyone.\n\nOkay, so let's get into, let's look at the docs.\n\nThat's what I always like to do before I get started with anything.\n\nLet's jump to code.visualstudio.com.\n\nOkay, so this code website, it's got some really great content here what are dev containers and what they're all about etc.\n\nProbably the big one to look at is this image here and this might help sort of cement this visual model of what is actually happening.","metadata":{"source":"/Users/andrewford/Developer/Blog/andrewford-co-nz-11ty/content/articles/dev-containers-in-vs-code/index.md","loc":{"lines":{"from":135,"to":151}}}}],["66d1c326-e034-4ae3-9e1a-1a2c6334ef0f",{"pageContent":"Probably the big one to look at is this image here and this might help sort of cement this visual model of what is actually happening.\n\nOkay so on the left you've got the local operating system and inside that you've got the VS code, you've got the theme, your UI, your extensions, blah blah blah.\n\nBut you've also got the source code.\n\nOkay so that's all sitting on your local machine.\n\nSo you've pulled down, cloned down a repo down to your machine and you've now got that source code there.\n\nYou've got the vs code, pretty much the same as what you're used to.\n\nIt's pretty normal.\n\nBut when you have a devcontainer.json file, one of the things that the yes code will do is it will pop up a little pop up saying \"Would you like to open this in a

locally on your machine and then make it available to work on.\n\nOkay so what does it do?\n\nYou can see there on the right in the container you've got this VS Code server.","metadata":{"source":"/Users/andrewford/Developer/Blog/andrewford-co-nz-11ty/content/articles/dev-containers-in-vs-code/index.md","loc":{"lines":{"from":163,"to":171}}}}],["cfc86972-3422-4e69-bf53-f5519fde2dcc",{"pageContent":"Okay so what does it do?\n\nYou can see there on the right in the container you've got this VS Code server.\n\nSo what it actually does is it actually runs VS Code the server which is another open source project, runs that locally in that container, it mounts the source code that's sitting on your machine and then with that container there you've got the file system, you've got the terminal process, you've got the running application debugger, all those are accessible from the VS Code server and VS Code opens that port and can read that VS Code server there and so it's just literally imaging what is in that same container.\n\nCool.\n\nOkay so let's actually let's go through set up a small project and we'll add a dev container to it and so you can see how it actually works.\n\nOkay let's get started with that.\n\nSo we're going to jump to Visual Studio Code here.\n\nSo I've got that open.\n\nPre-work visits you're going to need Docker.\n\nSee I've got Docker up in here, I've got the

want to have a look.\n\nHang on, I'll get the right link here.\n\nSo this is the extension ID here.\n\nIf you do search for that in your own VS code, that should come up with the right one.\n\nAnd you're going to need to install it of course.\n\nIt's got a few other prerequisites and it will sort itself out for you.\n\nOkay so once that's installed you've got Docker installed up and running,

can bring that back up again so if we do Command + Shift + P okay and go dev containers and we can do rebuild or open, okay open the folder in the container, we'll start with that one.\n\nIt's uh oh I'm sorry where am I?\n\nOpen, rebuild, don't worry, open in container.\n\nOkay very quickly, didn't really see that, here we go.\n\nIf you click on that quickly while you still have time.\n\nIt might

normally have to do if we were using just Docker alone, we'd go into the directory, we'd start docker compose, of course it would look at the compose file, start the docker and we'd all be running in that container.\n\nOkay, You'll notice one little sort of point of difference when you are running under a container there.\n\nYou can see down in the bottom left here, okay, so it's saying that we are editing on Dev Container, Nodejs and Postgres SQL.\n\nAnd it's basically if you pop that open, you've got a few other options here for things like attaching to the running container, you can configure the container features, all that kind of thing.\n\nAnd like I mentioned previously, you can even create a new code space with it.\n\nOkay, I'm gonna start a new

project.\n\nSo what we're actually looking at when we're looking at the terminal right now is what's in the container there.\n\nHow do we prove this.\n\nSo we can do something like this.\n\nWe can see the version there.\n\nOkay so it's saying that the node version there is version 20.\n\nOkay like when I, if you can cast your mind back you may want to jump back in the video later after we finished.\n\nBut you would have seen when I was setting up the devcontainer.json file there was this section there of the version of node for that image and it was version

and available to you at minus notice, which is way better than having to change all your whole configuration again.\n\nI've got one question in the chat.\n\nSo the dev container JSON is used to generate the Docker files or it has other uses as well.\n\nSo what does it have?\n\nLet's get back to it.\n\nOkay, I'll just close the terminal.\n\nOkay, OK.\n\nIt's got basically, let's just go through each part first.\n\nSo first of all, you've got a name so you can rename this to whatever you would like.\n\nYou've got the docker compose file so it's actually created a docker compose file

service has the name.\n\nSo this is actually linking to that app straight out of the box.\n\nWe've not had to set that all up for us and again the WorkSpaces folder again has been pre-configured for us again using that base folder name.\n\nSo when we were looking at that previously in the terminal we could see, was it my dev container.\n\nOkay, also this dev container has things like the features there, so we've got all the features configuration there for zsh.\n\nAnd not only that, you can also set up, which is probably what a lot of people would like, is things like port forwarding.","metadata":{"source":"/Users/andrewford/Developer/Blog/andrewford-co-nz-11ty/content/articles/dev-containers-in-vs-code/index.md","loc":{"lines":{"from":401,"to":419}}}}],["fb8b0f61-2093-471a-aad4-05ba80c63a5f",{"pageContent":"And

like things like browser and I'm going show you it's sort of using a RMS tool to be able to connect to a database.\n\nSo again we've got all that set up and we've got the ports.\n\nOne other thing that we can do which again making this whole developer experience much more smoother.\n\nWhat's normally the first thing you do when you have a no project when you want to get started.\n\nThat is that you're going to have to install an A module, don't you?\n\nAnd so one way to automate that whole process is we do actually have the ability to have this post create

installing all the node elements there.\n\nOkay, so that's done.\n\nLike I said before, we are running on the node 20 here.\n\nJust to prove that, I'm going to show you my terminal.\n\nOh, it's saying

would be able to clone it down as long as they've got Docker and they've got the dev containers extension.\n\nWhen they fire it up and they load up their VS Code, it'll ask them, do they want to open

from a container, the ports are being forwarded, so I know that the ports here being redirected you can see there I've got that Localize 3000.\n\nLet's also have a look at what is happening on the Docker site.\n\nOkay looks familiar we've got our project name and inside it we've got two containers.\n\nSo one container is a database and the other is the app.\n\nOkay so one is running the next app and the other one is running Postgres in there.\n\nSo this database of course is empty but I would be able to connect to it say from something like I've got bee keeper studio open

images of course on lots of different projects, you know speed's going to vary, but generally it's not too slow.\n\nAnd the cool thing is that even the database is contained.\n\nSo in this case, just trying to remember what's the Postgres version.\n\nWe can find out actually, we can go to the Docker files probably in here.\n\nDocker compose.\n\nSo let's just get him the latest version of Postgres there.\n\nSo again, this shouldn't be anything different to anyone that's used Docker before.\n\nYou've probably seen images etc.\n\nSo if we went to Docker Hub and we looked for that.\n\nTalk to you

before about any project is going to have some dependencies of some sort.\n\nThere may be something that you can't upgrade straight away.\n\nIt's going to require a whole lot of refactoring.\n\nSo because the dev containers are all self-contained, we could use an older version and not have to worry about an effecting our local machine.\n\nLet's go back to VS Code there.\n\nAlright.\n\nOkay,

before but um it just makes it a little bit easier to separate out all the three different parts of a mono repo.\n\nOkay, so this client, we have a docker file for your client, we have a docker file

Serverless functions, also known as Functions As A Service, are a way of building and running computer programs without needing to worry about the underlying servers or infrastructure. Instead, a cloud provider takes care of managing the servers and resources, and developers can just write and deploy their code. Serverless functions are triggered by specific events or requests and can quickly execute and shut down when they're finished. This makes them efficient, cost-effective and flexible, and they're often used for tasks that don't require continuous running or need to handle a lot of traffic.\n\nTo be able to make a fetch request, I'm going to add the [Node fetch package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-fetch) to my project, so we can make a get request from the Last FM API to get the last played track for my account.","metadata":{"source":"/Users/andrewford/Developer/Blog/andrewford-co-nz-11ty/content/articles/lastfm-widget-netlify-functions/index.md","loc":{"lines":{"from":39,"to":47}}}}],["b626f9dd-88fb-41bf-ad3a-ff7cc7fcd05a",{"pageContent":"```sh\nnpm install -D node-fetch@3\n```\n\nOnce we have that setup, we can create a JavaScript function to make the get request return the result. I've made my function an imported node fetch, and then made a handler function for my get request. I then pulled in my API key from the environment file that we created, and then you can see here we have a request with the API key added as a string literal. I then created a last track object and retrieved the appropriate details from the JSON data requested and finally returned the result. You can see I have my Last FM username in the string for the URL that we're calling.

The product information is retrieved before rendering and served server side (information will be displayed even if JavaScript is disabled).

But it doesn't get you that far before you have a huge amount of decisions to make. What routing should I use for my pages? What CSS in JS library? Should I use Tailwind? Will my website have good [SEO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine_optimization)? Very quickly you can be overloaded with decisions. This stems mostly from the fact that React is not a framework. It's a _library_.","metadata":{"source":"/Users/andrewford/Developer/Blog/andrewford-co-nz-11ty/content/articles/shop-nextjs-stripe-introduction/index.md","loc":{"lines":{"from":18,"to":22}}}}],["2113ad47-9236-4544-96df-7cf005459c96",{"pageContent":"[Next.js](https://nextjs.org) on the other hand is **\"The React Framework for Production\"**. With it a lot of the decisions have been made for you, letting you get up and running much faster. More importantly it solves a lot of the common problems that building a website/web app entail.\n\nYou will need to have an understanding of HTML, CSS and React of course to follow along with this series. I teach all these subjects at [Developers Institute](https://www.developers.ac.nz) where I'm a Tech Lead 😉\n\nTo get started building a Next.js application, hopefully you have Node installed ( if not [download here](https://nodejs.org/en/) ) and open up your terminal.\n\n```shell\nnpx create-next-app@latest\n```\n\nFollow the prompts and give it a name \"shop-nextjs-stripe\"\n\nHead into the directory with your new project and start the local development.\n\n```shell\ncd shop-nextjs-stripe\nnpm run dev\n```","metadata":{"source":"/Users/andrewford/Developer/Blog/andrewford-co-nz-11ty/content/articles/shop-nextjs-stripe-introduction/index.md","loc":{"lines":{"from":24,"to":41}}}}],["4f4f7012-6ee0-4cfc-bdab-de07fc9e4594",{"pageContent":"Follow the prompts and give it a name \"shop-nextjs-stripe\"\n\nHead into the directory with your new project and start the local development.\n\n```shell\ncd shop-nextjs-stripe\nnpm run dev\n```\n\nOpen your code editor and take a look at the folder structure. You will see 3 folders. The \"pages\" folder is where the routing happens. That will direct the url page in your app. For example if you had a file called `contact-us.js` to be routed to it you would have the following url your browser `http://localhost:3000/contact-us`. This will show the content from that component.\n\nYour **pages** folder will have a **api** folder and two files `_app.js` and `index.js`.\n\nOpen the project in a [browser](http://localhost:3000) and you should see something like this\n\n{% image \"./nextjs-start.png\", \"Next.JS Starter\" %}\n\nGreat the project is up and running in development mode 🙌","metadata":{"source":"/Users/andrewford/Developer/Blog/andrewford-co-nz-11ty/content/articles/shop-nextjs-stripe-introduction/index.md","loc":{"lines":{"from":34,"to":51}}}}],["6fb50949-193c-41cb-92ab-e7e03d208edc",{"pageContent":"{% image \"./nextjs-start.png\", \"Next.JS Starter\" %}\n\nGreat the project is up and running in development mode 🙌\n\nIn your code editor (I suggest you use [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com)) we will open the `index.js` file in the `pages` folder.\n\nWe are going to remove everything and replace it with the following:\n\n```jsx\nimport Head from \"next/head\";\n\nexport default function Home() {\n  return (\n    <>\n      <Head>\n        <title>Products</title>\n        <meta name=\"description\" content=\"Products\" />\n      </Head>\n    </>\n  );\n}\n```\n\nThat's cleared the standard install documentation links. Time to make our first component. Let's make a new folder called `components` and add a file `layout.js` in that directory.

You can just remain working on the component with the occasional look at the [Tailwind documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/box-sizing).\n\nSome more reasons to use Tailwind CSS are:","metadata":{"source":"/Users/andrewford/Developer/Blog/andrewford-co-nz-11ty/content/articles/what-is-tailwind-css/index.md","loc":{"lines":{"from":69,"to":75}}}}],["b49bfcaa-f6d4-4167-a608-5af8b3772735",{"pageContent":"- DRY: No repetition of code in your CSS files, `margin-left: 1rem` is only declared once in your stylesheet.

By default, you don't have naming conflicts and there are no confusion about names as styling is done at the property level.\n- The use of the Tailwind Labs official plugin for [VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bradlc.vscode-tailwindcss) enable autocomplete functionality. If you already know the name of CSS properties and have used the likes of [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2/utilities/spacing/#margin-and-padding) for padding and margin you will quickly feel familiar with Tailwind.\n- Another benefit is that you aren't changing the CSS, instead you are working on the HTML so there is little chance of breaking styling for other parts of your website.\n- You will only have to do a minimal amount of CSS work for the likes of theming or specific custom styles which means your CSS won't grow in size much at all. In fact with the build process your HTML can be scanned to look for the CSS classes and determine if they are not used and can be removed from the CSS file of the website. Therefore only creating a CSS file with the CSS classes used.\n- As the padding and margin values are predefined you won't get the same padding value declared multiple times scattered through your CSS file. You can also check at a glance are elements sharing the same padding or margin by the CSS classes applied without having to use the browser dev tools or find the class in the CSS.\n- No need to write media queries as instead you can use the [utility classes outlined here](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/responsive-design) in the vein of `md:w-32` to only apply the CSS class on the page being **medium** sized.","metadata":{"source":"/Users/andrewford/Developer/Blog/andrewford-co-nz-11ty/content/articles/what-is-tailwind-css/index.md","loc":{"lines":{"from":89,"to":94}}}}],["2fa09cfe-9349-4720-8628-9b1175462a0a",{"pageContent":"## When should I use Tailwind CSS?\n\nBased on my experience, Tailwind CSS is most effective when used on a team where some or most of the developers have limited CSS skills. Establishing a consistent design system using CSS can be a time-consuming process. It requires a solid understanding of CSS as well as strong communication skills to establish a process and create a style guide that all team members must adhere to, instead of relying on \"janky\" CSS hacks for the desired look from StackOverflow.\n\nTailwind CSS can simplify the documentation process by providing comprehensive documentation and resources for getting started, both from the official [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation) developers and the [community](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ft30zcMlFao). This can make it easier to understand and implement.\n\n## What are the downsides of Tailwind CSS?","metadata":{"source":"/Users/andrewford/Developer/Blog/andrewford-co-nz-11ty/content/articles/what-is-tailwind-css/index.md","loc":{"lines":{"from":96,"to":102}}}}],["6d032c7a-9f4e-4459-af8d-8a321c89677a",{"pageContent":"## What are the downsides of Tailwind CSS?\n\nAlthough Tailwind CSS offers many benefits, there are some drawbacks that could affect both the short-term and long-term success of your project:","metadata":{"source":"/Users/andrewford/Developer/Blog/andrewford-co-nz-11ty/content/articles/what-is-tailwind-css/index.md","loc":{"lines":{"from":102,"to":104}}}}],["4a95d9ba-8e7a-4512-b52d-1432416824fe",{"pageContent":"- File size: Tailwind requires a large number of CSS classes to be added to your HTML, which can lead to longer page load times and larger file sizes if not optimized properly.\n- Learning curve: Tailwind CSS requires a different approach to writing CSS, which can take some time to learn and adjust to.\n- Opinionated design: Tailwind CSS provides pre-defined classes that can be used to quickly style elements, but it also imposes a specific design aesthetic that may not align with the desired look and feel of the website or application.\n- Overuse of classes: Using too many classes on a single element can make the HTML difficult to read and understand, leading to a more complex and harder to maintain codebase.\n- Customization: Tailwind CSS is highly customizable, but this can also lead to increased complexity in terms of configuration, and can make it harder to maintain the design consistency across the project.\n- Hard to remove: It can be challenging to remove Tailwind CSS once it has been implemented. This is because the embedded Tailwind classes are present throughout your HTML, component, or template files, and removing them incrementally can create conflicts with the Tailwind build system. Additionally, it may further complicate the project by requiring an additional build process for the new setup to incrementally replace styling.\n- Waiting on bleeding edge CSS features: Recent years have seen significant advancements in browser CSS capabilities, such as [Container Queries](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Container_Queries), `:has()`, and [Subgrid](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout/Subgrid). While these features can enhance the design and functionality of a website, they can be difficult to implement using Tailwind. In some cases, it may be necessary to wait for them to become available in Tailwind or make changes to the implementation once they are supported.\n- Native is forever: When incorporating a new framework like Tailwind into a project, it will require a learning phase. However, it's important to note that the knowledge acquired is specific to the Tailwind framework, including its class names and naming conventions, which may not be transferable to other frameworks. On the other hand, using CSS in its native form and understanding its intended use will result in a knowledge that will remain useful for a long time.\n- Bare-bones by default: What makes Tailwind different to other frameworks like Bootstrap etc is that you will need to create basic components like footers and headers from scratch, unless you pay for [TailwindUI](https://tailwindui.com). These prebuilt components are not freely available as open source. Instead most build there own components from scratch using the Tailwind CSS classes.","metadata":{"source":"/Users/andrewford/Developer/Blog/andrewford-co-nz-11ty/content/articles/what-is-tailwind-css/index.md","loc":{"lines":{"from":106,"to":114}}}}],["1fa6458a-d899-40be-8491-9846eb2fc795",{"pageContent":"Tailwind can be a suitable choice for almost any team, especially those that have no strong lead in CSS.
